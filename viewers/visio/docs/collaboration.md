# Collaboration

File > Share starts a live session between windows of one browser. A host application can share across devices by setting the `collaboration` property, which takes the same options as every other Office editor.

::: warning Partial
There is no hosted service in this build. With File > Share nothing leaves your browser. Across devices you bring your own server (a y-websocket compatible URL), provider or Yjs session; pages and shapes merge item by item, everything else is shared whole (see below).
:::

## Embedding: the `collaboration` property

`<visio-viewer>` implements the shared embedding contract of `ooxml-core/collab` (`CollaborationOptions`, `CollaborationState`, `CollaborativeEditor`), the same one Word, Excel and PowerPoint take, so a host that embeds several products integrates once.

```ts
viewer.collaboration = {
	roomId: 'floor-plan', // 1 to 128 letters, digits, hyphens or underscores
	serverUrl: 'wss://example.com/collab', // optional: a y-websocket compatible server
	user: { name: 'Ada', color: '#2563eb' }, // optional; `role: 'viewer'` makes this window read-only
	intent: 'join', // optional: never seed an empty room with the drawing already open
};
viewer.addEventListener('collaboration-change', (event) => console.log(event.detail));
viewer.collaborationState; // { active, roomId, status, synced, people }
viewer.reconnectCollaboration();
viewer.stopCollaboration(); // or: viewer.collaboration = null
```

- **Transport**: `session` (a host-owned `CollabSession`, never destroyed by the viewer), else `provider`, else `webrtc`, else `serverUrl`, else a `BroadcastChannel` between windows of this browser.
- **Declarative**: while `collaboration` is set the open drawing is shared, and a drawing loaded later is shared too. Setting it to `null` leaves the room. A session the viewer opened itself is destroyed on leave; a host `session` is not.
- **Intent**: with `join` an empty room is not seeded with the local drawing, so a late joiner cannot overwrite a room that has not loaded yet. A drawing loaded or edited afterwards is still published. Default `create`.
- **Roles**: `role: 'viewer'` makes the viewer read-only while it is in the room (`canEdit` is restored when it leaves). The role is advisory; a server must enforce it.
- **Events**: `collaboration-change` carries a `CollaborationState` when sharing starts or stops and when the connection status, first sync or people change. A failed join is reported as `document-error`. File > Share uses the same controller, so starting from the panel reports state and the event too.
- **Bindings**: every binding forwards a `collaboration` prop (React, Vue, Solid, Svelte, vanilla `mountViewer`/`update`, Angular `[collaboration]`) and relays `collaboration-change` (`events['collaboration-change']`, Vue `@collaboration-change`, Angular `(collaborationChange)`). Unmounting leaves the room.
- **Types**: `VisioCollaborationOptions` (the shared options plus `onWriteBack`, `writeBackDebounceMs` and `writeBackRetry`) and `VisioCollaborationState` are exported from `ooxml-ui/visio`, and every binding's `collaboration` prop is typed with the same options.

## Server and peer-to-peer: auth token and WebRTC

```ts
// A y-websocket compatible server. The token is sent as the `token` query parameter:
// wss://example.com/collab/floor-plan?token=<authToken>
viewer.collaboration = {
	roomId: 'floor-plan',
	serverUrl: 'wss://example.com/collab',
	authToken: await getToken(),
};

// Peer to peer over y-webrtc. Pass the `WebrtcProvider` class from your own y-webrtc install;
// the viewer does not bundle it. The room password defaults to `authToken`.
import { WebrtcProvider } from 'y-webrtc';
viewer.collaboration = {
	roomId: 'floor-plan',
	authToken: 'room password',
	webrtc: { WebrtcProvider, signaling: ['wss://signal.example.com'] },
};
```

The viewer hands these options to `openCollaborationSession` untouched. The token only authenticates to the server you run (the server must check it), and a WebRTC password only keeps peers without it out of the room; neither makes roles anything more than advisory. Peer-to-peer rooms never confirm a first sync, so the session's grace period decides when this window may write.

## Live cursors and selections

Collaborators on the same page see each other's pointer (a cursor with the person's name in their colour) and selected shapes (a dashed outline in their colour) over the canvas. They move and scale with the zoom and pan of the drawing, and disappear when the person leaves, goes to another page, moves the pointer off the page, clears the selection, or goes stale.

The payload each window publishes is `{ page, x?, y?, selection? }`: the page id, the pointer in the page's drawing units (inches) and up to 64 selected shape ids. `sanitizeVisioPresence` (exported from `ooxml-core/visio/ui`) validates every inbound payload. The viewer applies it to sessions it opens itself. **A host-owned `session` should be created with it**, otherwise its peers carry no payload and no cursors or selections are drawn (nothing breaks):

```ts
import { createCollabSession } from 'ooxml-core/collab';
import { sanitizeVisioPresence, VISIO_INITIAL_PRESENCE } from 'ooxml-core/visio/ui';

const session = createCollabSession({
	roomId: 'floor-plan',
	provider,
	user: { name: 'Ada' },
	sanitizePayload: sanitizeVisioPresence,
	initialPresence: VISIO_INITIAL_PRESENCE,
});
viewer.collaboration = { session };
```

Limits: the cursor and selection are shown only for the page both people have open; selection outlines cover top-level and nested shapes by their saved frame, not by their rendered geometry.

## Owner write-back

A host that wants the shared drawing saved can set `onWriteBack` and optionally `writeBackDebounceMs` (default 5000):

```ts
viewer.collaboration = {
	roomId: 'floor-plan',
	user: { name: 'Ada', role: 'owner' },
	onWriteBack: (bytes) => upload(bytes), // VSDX bytes
	writeBackDebounceMs: 5000,
};
```

Only the window whose role is `owner` writes, so collaborators never race each other to save. The callback fires after the drawing has been quiet for the debounce, following local and remote changes, and once more when the owner leaves the room if a save is pending. It never fires for `collaborator` or `viewer`. The same options shape as PowerPoint's `onWriteBack`, on the same scheduler (`createWriteBackScheduler` of `ooxml-core/collab`).

Return a promise from `onWriteBack` to acknowledge storage: one write is in flight at a time, changes made meanwhile become one follow-up write, and a rejection is retried when you set `writeBackRetry` (`{ attempts, baseDelayMs?, maxDelayMs? }`, exponential backoff, `attempts` counts the first try; default no retry). A plain return counts as acknowledged at once. The owner's `collaborationState.writeBack` (also in `collaboration-change`) reports `{ status: 'idle' | 'pending' | 'saving' | 'saved' | 'failed', lastSavedAt?, error? }`; other roles do not report it. `saved` means your callback resolved, nothing more.

A pending save is flushed when the viewer leaves the room, on `pagehide` and when the page turns hidden. Browsers do not wait for asynchronous work when a page unloads, so a write that needs a network round trip can still be lost on close. A host whose `write` must survive a close should send the bytes with `navigator.sendBeacon(url, bytes)` or `fetch(url, { method: 'PUT', body: bytes, keepalive: true })`, which the browser completes after the page is gone (keepalive bodies are capped at about 64 KiB, so a large document may still not make it).

## What exists today

- A live session built on `ooxml-core/collab` (Yjs) over a `BroadcastChannel`, so windows and tabs of the same browser can share a drawing.
- Pages, shapes (down to cells, rows and sections), connectors, masters and pictures are shared item by item (`ooxml-core/visio/collab`); every other part of the package (styles, theme, data, document settings) is shared whole, last write wins per part. The collab runtime loads only when sharing starts.
- Concurrent edits to different shapes both survive; two edits of one shape resolve to one value on every window; a deleted shape or page wins over a concurrent edit of it; shapes given the same id by two windows at once are renumbered the same way everywhere.
- Undo and redo (Ctrl+Z, the ribbon) act on this window's own edits only and never revert a collaborator's. Remote changes are applied outside your undo history, and the history starts when you join.
- Collaborators appear through the shared `ooxml-ui` presence element.
- The session name is 1 to 128 letters, digits, hyphens or underscores. A window joining a session whose room already holds a drawing adopts it; otherwise it seeds the room (unless the host asked for `intent: 'join'`).
- Panel sessions keep their original BroadcastChannel name (`ooxml-collab:visio-<room>`), so windows on an older build still meet.

## Live demo: two windows, any framework

A sharing session is just a name. Both panes below are separate playgrounds, built from different framework bindings, that join the session `docs-collab` on load: window A is the vanilla playground and opens the sample, window B is the React playground and receives the drawing from the room. Edit shape text in one pane and watch the other follow; undo reverts the remote step.

<iframe
	src="/ooxml/visio/demo/?embed=1&sample=1&share=docs-collab"
	title="visio-viewer window A (vanilla)"
	loading="lazy"
	allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write; fullscreen"
	style="width: 100%; height: 640px; border: 1px solid var(--vp-c-divider); border-radius: 8px"
></iframe>

	loading="lazy"
	allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write; fullscreen"
	style="width: 100%; height: 640px; border: 1px solid var(--vp-c-divider); border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 1rem"
></iframe>

### Pair any two frameworks

Every playground accepts `?share=<session>`, which fills in File > Share and starts it. Only the session name matters, so any pairing works: the home page [live demo](/#live-demo) has a framework picker for each window, and in two tabs you can open, for example, `/demo-vue/?sample=1&share=my-room` and `/demo-angular/?share=my-room`. You can also do it by hand in any two windows: File, then Share, then the same session name.

### Why File > Share is same-browser only

The panel uses a `BroadcastChannel`, which connects windows, tabs and frames of one browser profile on one origin, whichever framework they were built with, and nothing else. Two different machines cannot meet this way; a host sets `collaboration` with a `serverUrl`, `provider` or `session` for that, and this build ships no server.

### Limits of shape-level merging

- Two people editing different properties of the same shape (a move and a text or fill change, different cells, rows or sections) both keep their change. Two people editing the same cell, or the same text, end with one value, the same in every window. Whole `Text` or `Data` children are one unit each. Edits inside one master merge the same way (per shape and cell), and a master one person deletes wins over a concurrent edit inside it.
- Page parts are split by text, so cells round-trip exactly as the editor wrote them (whitespace between elements is dropped). A page part that cannot be split (no usable `Shapes` list) falls back to sharing its shapes as part of the page shell, last write wins.
- Masters and media merge per item: masters added by two people at once both stay, and pictures are keyed by content, so identical pictures are stored once and different pictures that share a file name both stay (one is renamed). Styles, theme, document settings, data and the content types part still merge per part, last write wins. The window state and thumbnail stay local.
- When two windows add shapes with the same id at once, one is renumbered; the same room content always gives the same numbers on every window. The `Sheet.n!...` formulas follow the shape they were written for, wherever and whenever they were typed (each formula remembers which shape it names, so a formula typed at the very moment of the collision, in an older shape or by another person, still points at the shape its author meant). A window that can write then saves the numbers in the room, for the shape that moved and for the one that kept its number, so neither changes when more shapes are added later, even a shape added at the same moment with the same number. Undo never reverts that step, and undoing a formula edit still reverts it. Only one case can still move a number once: two windows saving different numberings at the same moment for a room that also holds an add the other had not seen; the room settles on every window right after. Pages and masters renumber the same way (the shapes added with a master follow it).
- A glue (connect) removed by one person and re-made identically by another keeps the re-made one. Pictures of removed media stay in the room (not garbage-collected). A cell, master or picture one person deletes while another edits it keeps the edit; a deleted shape or page always wins.
- A room written by another schema version of the collaboration format (an older or newer build) is refused: the window reports an error and neither reads from nor writes to that room. Upgrade every window of a room together.
- Undo history is per window, starts at join, and is not kept across a reconnect. Remote changes that arrive together are applied with one rebuild, and a change that leaves the drawing as it is applies nothing, but when only the content of some pages changed (and you did not edit meanwhile), just those pages are read again and the others are kept (the styles, themes and masters are not read again while they are unchanged, and unchanged parts of the package are not re-checksummed); a change to the page list, masters, styles, theme, document settings or pictures, the first drawing you adopt, and the first remote change after one of your own edits re-read the whole package, so a very large drawing is still fully read in those cases.

The evidence is recorded in the [capability ledger](/parity) under "Collaboration and comments".
