A thin MCP wrapper: the tools themselves (names, schemas, bounds and operations) are
`visioTools` in `ooxml-core/automation`, registered with `registerAutomationTools` from
`ooxml-core/automation/node`. Requires `ooxml-core` 1.22.0 or later, installed as a dependency.

## Install

```bash
npm install visio-viewer-mcp
```

## Quick start

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"visio": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "--package=visio-viewer-mcp", "visio-tools", "/path/to/documents"]
		}
	}
}
```

Paths are scoped to the configured root (the current directory by default).
Save-as never overwrites existing files. Edit tools update the source
unless `outputPath` names a new file. Files are written atomically after core
validation. Unsupported features and preservation limitations are returned by core.

## Features

VSDX inspection and batches of supported text and geometry edits. All document
algorithms live in OOXML core. Importing the package does not start stdio.

## Limitations

Unsupported operations report errors or core diagnostics. Office parity and lossless
export are not established. Updates overwrite the source unless `outputPath` is supplied.

## API

Programmatic integration: `createServer({ rootDir })` or
`registerTools(existingMcpServer, { rootDir })`. Importing the package does not
start a transport. The OOXML combined MCP calls this same registration function.

This package ships JavaScript source and needs no separate build step.

The package exposes `visio_inspect` and `visio_edit` for `.vsdx` files.
`visio_edit` supports core-validated plain text replacement, move, resize, delete
and rectangle creation. Coordinates use inches with a bottom-left origin.
There is no standalone create-document tool. Unsupported edits reject; inspect
and edit results include diagnostics about fidelity limits.
