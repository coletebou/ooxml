# Native Visio viewer bindings

Six thin native integrations use one browser element and one `mountViewer` implementation:

- Vanilla: `src/vanilla.ts`, `mountViewer`
- React: `src/react.ts`, `VisioViewer`
- Vue 3: `src/vue.ts`, `VisioViewer`
- Angular: `src/angular.ts`, `VisioViewerComponent` (`visio-viewer-host`)
- Svelte 5: `src/VisioViewer.svelte`, default `VisioViewer`
- Solid: `src/solid.tsx`, `VisioViewer`

This package is private source inside the repository. It is not a published, standalone npm artifact. It imports the canonical viewer through relative source paths; a distribution build and packed-consumer verification are required before publication. Import a specific framework entry point to avoid loading unrelated framework runtimes.

## Shared contract

Every handle exposes `createBlankDrawing(options?: CreateVsdxOptions)` through
the shared element. Width and height are physical inches; omission creates a
Letter page. Accepted creation replaces source, selection and history and updates
each framework's existing state hook. The Svelte component forwards this method
directly as well as through `getHandle()`.

All adapters accept the same properties:

- `document`: a `VisioDocument` or `null` to clear it
- `pageIndex`: zero-based page index
- `zoom`: scale, where `1` means 100%
- `showToolbar`: toolbar visibility
- `canEdit`: editing permission. The full viewer defaults to editable; `false` makes it read-only (selection, search, zoom and export keep working). The building blocks default to read-only instead, see [building blocks](../../docs/building-blocks.md)
- `ribbonAddIns`: tabs the host adds after Help (see [Ribbon add-in tabs](../../docs/api.md#ribbon-add-in-tabs))
- `collaboration`: shares the open drawing in a room while set, `null` leaves it (see [collaboration](../../docs/collaboration.md))
- `events`: typed callback map using literal event names

The event map currently contains `document-load`, `document-change`, `document-error`, `page-change`, `zoom-change`, `shape-select`, `selection-change`, `office-ribbon-add-in` and `collaboration-change`. It is derived from the canonical contract. All adapters pass every event; none parse documents or own another renderer.

Property updates are partial. Native framework snapshots are diffed so unrelated rerenders do not undo an imperative load or a user-changed viewport. Omitted or `undefined` properties preserve current viewer state. `null` explicitly clears the document. Removing the `events` prop clears callback-map handlers. Supply a new document object for an external replacement; in-place mutation is not a supported reactivity mechanism. Page and zoom interactions may update internal viewer state; the props request changes when their framework updates them.

`document-change` carries `{ document, dirty, kind }` where kind is `edit`, `undo`, `redo`, `remote` (a collaborator's change) or `save` (after `markClean()`). The imperative `ViewerHandle` exposes `element`, `controller`, `load(bytesOrBlob)` and `fit()`. Editing methods include `applyEdits(edits)`, `replacePlainText(pageId, shapeId, text)`, `duplicateSelection()`, `copySelection()`, `cutSelection()`, `pasteSelection()`, `undo()`, `redo()`, `cancelEdit()` and `exportVsdx()`. After the host has saved the exported bytes it calls `controller.markClean()`. Collaboration is driven through the property; `element.collaborationState`, `element.reconnectCollaboration()` and `element.stopCollaboration()` are on the handle's `element`. Clipboard preparation state is available at `controller.state.clipboard` through each native reactive subscription; clipboard methods require a browser user gesture and support the bounded viewer shape format. They forward to the same source-backed worker-isolated implementation. `ViewerEditState` and `VsdxExportResult` are shared exported types; state is available at `controller.state.edit`. Angular exposes the native `documentChange` output; every adapter supports the `document-change` callback map. Read access and operations through a framework handle fail clearly before mounting or after unmounting. A retained controller or element is also disposed when the owner unmounts. Vanilla returns the full shared binding with `update()` and idempotent `destroy()`.

The editor itself mounts on the client. Separate Node tests verify all six entry points import without browser globals; React, Vue, Svelte and Solid also render empty native hosts on the server. React and Vue have tests hydrating their actual server markup before mounting the shared element. Angular server rendering and Solid/Svelte hydration remain unverified, as does cross-document mounting. These checks use the installed versions and do not imply full SSR-framework integration coverage.

## Native usage

React uses a forwarded ref and ordinary props:

```tsx
const ref = useRef<ViewerHandle>(null);
<VisioViewer ref={ref} document={diagram} events={{ 'document-error': reportError }} />;
```

Vue exposes the same handle on its component ref and also emits the native kebab-case events:

```vue
<VisioViewer ref="viewer" :document="diagram" @document-error="reportError" />
```

Angular exposes native inputs and outputs. Add the standalone component to the application's imports:

```html
<visio-viewer-host [document]="diagram" (documentError)="reportError($event)" />
```

Angular outputs are `documentLoad`, `documentChange`, `documentError`, `pageChange`, `zoomChange`, `shapeSelect`, `selectionChange`, `ribbonAddIn` and `collaborationChange`. The complete `events` callback map is also accepted as an input. Vue and Angular invoke the callback-map handler and then emit their native output; use either API unless both notifications are intended.

For large immutable document models, use Vue `shallowRef`/`markRaw` and Svelte `$state.raw` rather than deeply proxying a newly constructed options object on every update. Rewrapping a document in a new reactive proxy changes its identity and requests an external replacement. In-place mutation is not supported.

Svelte uses native callback props through `events`. Its component exports `load`, `fit`, and `getHandle` so the complete typed handle is accessible without exposing private DOM:

```svelte
<VisioViewer bind:this={viewer} document={diagram}
  events={{ 'document-error': reportError }} />
```

Solid supplies a ref callback with the handle on mount and `undefined` on unmount or ref replacement:

```tsx
<VisioViewer
	document={diagram()}
	viewerRef={setViewer}
	events={{ 'document-error': reportError }}
/>
```

Vanilla owns only the child it creates:

```ts
const viewer = mountViewer(host, { document: diagram, zoom: 1 });
viewer.update({ events: { 'document-error': reportError } });
// Later:
viewer.destroy();
```

Style hooks are native to each framework: React `className`/`style`, Vue inherited attributes, Angular host attributes, Svelte `class`/`style`, and Solid `class`/`style`. The application must give the host a usable height. Shared viewer styling and accessibility live in the custom element.

## Native state

Viewer state includes page, zoom, selection, search, editing and undo availability. Each framework subscribes to the shared controller rather than polling the element:

| Framework | State API                                                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| React     | `useVisioViewerState(viewerRef)` returns `ViewerState` or `null`        |
| Vue       | `useVisioViewerState(templateRef)` returns a read-only shallow ref      |
| Angular   | `viewer.state()` reads the component's read-only signal                 |
| Svelte    | `viewer.getState()` returns a read-only store                           |
| Solid     | `createVisioViewerState(handleAccessor)` returns an accessor            |
| Vanilla   | `viewer.controller.subscribe(listener)` returns an unsubscribe function |

Native hooks follow viewer replacement and conditional remounts, detach old controller subscriptions and expose `null` while no viewer is mounted. Vanilla consumers own their subscription cleanup: call the returned unsubscribe function before destroying or replacing the mounted viewer. Old controller updates cannot change a replacement viewer's state. These lifecycle checks cover all six adapters, including React StrictMode effect replay.

`state.selectedShapes` is an ordered, immutable array. Its first item is the primary `selectedShape`, and the existing `shape-select` callback retains that primary-selection payload. `selection-change` reports the complete array. Vue exposes a native `selection-change` event, Angular exposes `selectionChange`, and every adapter accepts the shared `events['selection-change']` callback.

All six handles provide `selectShapes(targets)`, `selectAll()` and `clearSelection()`. Shift, Ctrl or Meta clicking toggles a shape; clicking the background clears the selection. Hidden or deleted targets are removed, selected groups exclude their descendants, and switching pages or documents clears selection. Single-target text and geometry panels require exactly one selected shape.

## Checks

Install the workspace once from the repository root (`bun install`), then run the checks from `viewers/visio`:

```sh
bun run check:bindings   # runs `bun run --cwd packages/bindings check`
```

`ooxml-core` and `ooxml-ui` resolve to the workspace packages in this repository. This package does not replace or fork the parser.

Checks include TypeScript, `svelte-check`, native runtime lifecycle tests and real-element integration:

- React StrictMode mount, cleanup and remount
- Native state subscription replacement, conditional remount and stale-controller isolation
- Native prop diffing preserves imperative documents/user zoom across unrelated updates
- Late Blob success and failure after unmount/remount cannot affect the new viewer
- Throwing ref-release callbacks cannot prevent Solid resource cleanup
- No-DOM SSR imports and server rendering; React/Vue server-markup hydration
- Native Vue, Angular zoneless, Svelte and Solid mounting and reactive updates
- All property names, every event key, latest callbacks and callback removal
- Retained handle rejection after unmount
- Actual shared custom-element rendering and malformed-load rejection through all six adapters
- Disposal clears the real element, listeners and owned DOM

The focused lifecycle tests mock only the shared mount to isolate framework wiring. The integration matrix uses the real controller, parser and custom element. These tests run in jsdom and do not replace real-browser visual, accessibility, layout or framework-version compatibility tests. Only the installed versions are currently verified.

## Editing scope

Editing is experimental and source-backed. Load package bytes before editing; assigning a `VisioDocument` model alone remains read-only. `applyEdits()` forwards atomic geometry, text, formatting and ordering commands to the shared core. Plain-text replacement rejects master-linked text, rich text and fields; other commands have their own admission rules. Signed packages and macro content remain unsupported. The shared Home ribbon supports multi-selection formatting, alignment/distribution and deletion. History is bounded. Native Visio save/reopen evidence covers specific formatting and arrangement captures, not general fidelity; see `docs/verification.md` and `docs/parity.md` for current limits. `exportVsdx()` returns copy bytes and diagnostics without downloading or overwriting a file; consumers choose an explicit save/download action. A `document-change` callback reports `{ document, dirty, kind }`, with kind `edit`, `undo`, `redo`, `remote` or `save`. Unrelated framework rerenders must not replace an edited model with stale props.
