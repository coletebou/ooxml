# Element API and events

Every binding wraps the same `<teams-app>` custom element. The bindings forward these properties and re-emit these events in their framework's idiom (see the [framework guides](/frameworks/react)).

## Attributes and properties

| Property        | Attribute       | Description                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workspaceId`   | `workspace-id`  | The shared room: 1 to 128 characters of letters, digits, `-` and `_`.                                                        |
| `userName`      | `user-name`     | Display name.                                                                                                                |
| `userId`        | `user-id`       | Stable id; defaults to one remembered in this browser.                                                                       |
| `config`        | `server-config` | `{ mode: 'local' \| 'server', syncUrl?, signalingUrl?, iceServers, iceTransportPolicy?, token? }`. The attribute takes JSON. |
| `uploadFile`    |                 | Where attachments go; defaults to the server's `/files` endpoint.                                                            |
| `openers`       |                 | Per-Office-type handlers (`docx`, `xlsx`, `pptx`, `vsdx`).                                                                   |
| `embeds`        |                 | Per-file-kind callbacks returning a sandbox-compatible viewer page URL; useful for PowerPoint.                               |
| `client` (read) |                 | The core client behind the element (state in, actions out).                                                                  |

Leave `config` out and the element offers a settings dialog (remembered in this browser) or runs in local mode.

## Content previews

Opening an attachment displays a workspace preview by default. Word and Excel use
the native editor elements, initially read-only; Visio uses its viewer. Markdown has a safe
subset renderer; text files show literal text; HTML and websites use sandboxed
frames. `openers` and the cancelable `teams-open-file` event still take precedence.

PowerPoint requires an embedding page supplied by the host:

```ts
const embeds = {
	pptx: ({ url }: { url: string | undefined }) =>
		`https://viewer.example.com/embed?source=${encodeURIComponent(url ?? '')}`,
};
```

Pass `embeds` to any component binding. The page must understand the file URL and
support a sandbox with scripts/forms but no same-origin permission. File fetches
omit credentials; cross-origin file servers must allow CORS. Without a configured
PowerPoint viewer, the pane reports that limitation and offers external open.

The element's `previewContent({ attachment, url })` method opens host-provided
content locally. For a website use `attachment: { name: 'Project site', kind:
'other', mime: 'text/html' }`. This does not create a shared channel tab. The
Files view also offers **Preview website**. Sites that refuse framing can be
opened externally.

## Shared channel tabs and Excel copies

Use **Pin as tab** beside an uploaded file, or **Add tab** to add a named website.
Definitions are shared; each user selects their own tab. The creator can rename
or remove it through client-side ownership checks. Removing a tab elsewhere keeps
an already open local pane available until it is closed.

Excel offers local editing and **Save copy to channel** when file storage is
configured. Each save uploads a uniquely named copy and posts it in the originating
channel, preserving the original. Failed saves retain edits; navigation confirms
discarding unsaved work and waits for an in-progress save. This is not coediting
or versioned write-back. Hosts forcibly replacing the workspace or element must
handle their own unsaved-work confirmation.

Raw client actions:

```ts
const tab = teams.addTab('Budget', { type: 'file', attachment });
teams.addTab('Project site', { type: 'website', url: 'https://example.com' });
teams.renameTab(tab!.id, 'Budget review');
teams.removeTab(tab!.id);
await teams.saveFileCopy(channelId, file);
```

`TeamsState.tabs` contains the selected channel's definitions;
`canUploadFiles` indicates configured storage. `OpenFileDetail.channelId` records
the channel captured when opening. `previewContent` also accepts this field when
a host wants to enable channel save copies. Ownership checks require server-side
authorization before they can be treated as access control.

## File creation, upload and search

Both Files views offer upload, blank Excel workbook creation and search. Uploads
and new workbooks target the selected channel, which is named beside the controls.
They need configured storage; failures can be retried in the original channel.
Same-name files use separate storage URLs. Uploads accept up to 20 files of 32 MiB
each (the reference server's own cap is 25 MB per file unless you raise `maxFileBytes`); the UI reports activity but does not offer byte progress or cancellation.

```ts
await teams.uploadFiles(channelId, files);
const workbook = await teams.createWorkbook(channelId, 'Budget'); // Budget.xlsx
```

Creation posts an attachment backed by a real XLSX file. Search filters the loaded
metadata by file name, author, channel and recognized kind. It does not search
inside file contents. These actions capture the explicit channel before asynchronous
creation or upload, so selecting another channel cannot redirect the result.

## Events

| Event                 | Meaning                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `teams-ready`         | The element is ready.                                                               |
| `teams-open-file`     | A user opened an attached file. Cancelable: `preventDefault()` to open it yourself. |
| `teams-config-change` | The user saved new server settings in the settings dialog.                          |

Binding spellings: `onReady`, `onOpenFile`, `onConfigChange` (React, Solid, Svelte, vanilla); `@ready`, `@open-file`, `@config-change` (Vue); `(ready)`, `(openFile)`, `(configChange)` (Angular).

## The raw client

`createTeams(options)` (the raw hook in every binding) returns the core client:

```ts
const stop = teams.subscribe(() => render(teams.getState())); // coalesced per tick
teams.send({ text: 'hello' });
teams.on('notice', (notice) => show(notice)); // errors a user should see
```

`getState()` is one immutable `TeamsState`: connection `status`, `channels` with unread counts, the selected channel's `messages`, `files` and `pinned` messages, `people` (presence, including status messages), your own `presence`, `typing`, the composer state, search results and `call`. Actions include `select`, `createChannel`, `send`, `startReply`, `startEdit`, `deleteMessage`, `toggleReaction`, `pinMessage`, `unpinMessage`, `notifyTyping`, `setAvailability(status, duration?)`, `setStatusMessage(message, duration?)`, `setIdleMinutes`, `noteActivity`, `search`, `openCall`, `joinCall`, `leaveCall`, `toggleMic`, `toggleCamera`, `toggleScreenShare`, `toggleHand` and `destroy`. See [Architecture](/architecture) for how the layers fit.
