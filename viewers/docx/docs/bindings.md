# Framework bindings

All bindings mount `<docx-editor>` through the same `mountEditor` function. A property assignment is an external document replacement, not an edit event. `document-change` carries a `DocumentModel` directly; `document-error` carries an `Error`. Both events bubble across the shadow boundary.

React:

```tsx
import { WordEditor } from 'docx-react-viewer';
<WordEditor documentModel={model} readOnly={false} onDocumentChange={setModel} />;
```

`ref` exposes `element`, `load(bytes)` and `save()`.

Vue:

```vue
<script setup>
import { WordEditor } from 'docx-vue-viewer';
</script>
<template>
	<WordEditor :document-model="model" @document-change="model = $event" />
</template>
```

Angular:

```ts
import { WordEditorComponent } from 'docx-angular-viewer';
// Add WordEditorComponent to your standalone component imports.
```

```html
<word-editor [documentModel]="model" [readOnly]="false" (documentChange)="model = $event" />
```

Svelte 5:

```svelte
<script>
  import WordEditor from 'docx-svelte-viewer';
  let model = $state(initialDocument);
</script>
<WordEditor documentModel={model} ondocumentchange={next => model = next} />
```

SolidJS:

```tsx
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js';
import { WordEditor } from 'docx-solid-viewer';

function DocumentEditor() {
	const [model, setModel] = createSignal(initialDocument);
	return <WordEditor documentModel={model()} onDocumentChange={setModel} />;
}
```

Solid uses the same `documentModel`, `readOnly`, `locale`, `onDocumentChange`, and
`onDocumentError` options as the shared adapter. Use `editorRef` to obtain the
mounted editor's `element`, `load`, and `save` methods. The Solid owner cleans up
the editor and its listeners when the component unmounts.

Custom element:

```ts
import { registerDocxEditor } from 'docx-vanilla-viewer';
registerDocxEditor();
const element = document.createElement('docx-editor');
element.documentModel = model;
document.body.append(element);
```

The vanilla mount adapter is exported from `docx-vanilla-viewer` and returns update, destroy, load, save, and element operations. It avoids feedback resets when a parent returns the emitted model. Supply a new object for external model changes; mutating a model in place is not a supported reactivity mechanism.

Framework packages use their own native lifecycle and ref APIs. No framework template contains a toolbar, page renderer or document command implementation. SSR imports do not register elements; mounting is a client operation. The current browser contract validates the installed versions, not every historical peer version.

Set the optional `locale` prop on any framework editor to localize the ribbon and search controls (`en`, `fr`, `de`, `es` or `zh-CN`; for example, `locale="de"`). This affects interface text only; it does not translate document content.

## Window chrome and file commands

The editor draws Word-style chrome inside its shadow root: a title bar (quick-access Save,
Undo and Redo, the file name and save state, a "Tell me what you want to do" command search),
the Editing/Viewing mode switch, **Comments** and **Share** at the right end of the ribbon tab
row (as in Word 365), a **File** tab with a backstage (Info with
compatibility notes, New, Open, Save, Save a copy as DOCX, Print), and a status bar (page,
words, compatibility notes, Web/Print Layout and zoom).

Set `element.fileName` to name the open document. File commands are announced first as a
cancelable `file-command` event whose `detail.command` is `new`, `open`, `save`, `export`,
`print` or `share`. Call `preventDefault()` to handle it in your application (for example to save
to your own storage); otherwise the editor uses its browser-only default: a file picker, a
download, or the print dialog. `share` (the Share button) has no default: starting a session needs
your transport and authority, so handle it and call `startCollaboration`. Choosing **Viewing** raises `readonly-change`.

```ts
editor.fileName = 'Quarterly report.docx';
editor.addEventListener('file-command', (event) => {
	const { command } = (event as CustomEvent<{ command: string }>).detail;
	if (command === 'save') {
		event.preventDefault();
		void editor.save().then(uploadToMyStorage);
	}
});
```

## Saving, dirty state and UI options

`save()` resolves to a `Blob` of the serialized document (`saveBytes()` returns the raw
`Uint8Array`), `download(fileName?)` saves and starts a browser download, and `dirty` /
`dirty-change` report unsaved edits. `dirty` becomes true on `document-change` and false after
File > Save, `download()`, loading a document or `markClean()`; `save()` alone does not clear it
because only the host knows whether the Blob was persisted. Every adapter exposes
`save`, `download`, `markClean` and `dirty` on its handle and `onDirtyChange` / `onPageChange`
(or the framework's event equivalent).

| Property (attribute)                 | Default | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `showThumbnails` (`show-thumbnails`) | `false` | Left rail of page thumbnails. Thumbnails need Print Layout; in Draft view the rail says so instead of listing pages.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `showToolbar` (`show-toolbar`)       | `true`  | `show-toolbar="false"` hides the ribbon; the title bar and status bar remain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `hiddenActions`                      | `[]`    | Ribbon controls to hide by stable kebab-case id (`RIBBON_ACTION_IDS`, e.g. `'bold'`, `'insert-table'`, `'track-changes'`, `'paste'`, `'word-count'`); empty groups and tabs hide too. A colour button and its dropdown caret hide together. Unknown ids are ignored. Ids do not change with `locale`. |
| `ribbonAddIns`                       | none    | Tabs the host adds after the built-in ones; see [Ribbon add-in tabs](#ribbon-add-in-tabs).                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

**Deprecated:** before ids existed `hiddenActions` took the English control label (`'Bold'`,
`'Insert table'`). Those `LegacyRibbonLabel` strings are still accepted for one more release: they
are mapped to ids and the element dispatches one `document-warning` per assignment. Reading
`hiddenActions` always returns ids. `ribbon-action` events never carried labels (their detail is
keyed by command type), so they are unchanged.

`page-change` (`{ page, pageCount }`) fires from Print Layout only. Pagination comes from this
editor's own layout engine and is an approximation, not Word's pagination; the status bar and
rail tooltips say so.

## Ribbon add-in tabs

A host can add its own ribbon tabs after Word's own, as an Office add-in does.
`ribbonAddIns` takes plain data and is a prop of every binding; a chosen command
runs its `run` callback and is reported through `onRibbonAddIn` (Vue
`office-ribbon-add-in`, Angular `ribbonAddIn`, Svelte `onribbonaddin`) with
`{ tab, command }`.

```tsx
const tabs = [
	{
		id: 'reports',
		label: 'Reports',
		groups: [
			{
				label: 'Export',
				commands: [
					{ id: 'export', label: 'Export', icon: 'save', run: () => exportReport() },
					{ id: 'options', label: 'Options', size: 'small' },
					{ id: 'send', label: 'Send', items: [{ id: 'send-mail', label: 'By mail' }] },
				],
			},
		],
	},
];

<WordEditor ribbonAddIns={tabs} onRibbonAddIn={({ tab, command }) => track(tab, command)} />;
```

`size: 'small'` commands fill columns of three and `items` makes a drop-down.
Passing an equal descriptor again, as a framework does on every render, keeps
the panels and only replaces the callbacks; leaving the prop out removes the
tabs. A tab cannot take the id of a built-in tab, and its commands never reach
the editor's own command handling. The same descriptor (`RibbonAddInTab`, from
`ooxml-core/ribbon`, re-exported by every framework package) works in the Word,
Excel, PowerPoint and Visio editors. No add-in tab ships with the editor.

## Binding props and events

Every framework adapter forwards the same element props and re-emits the same events, so the
names below mean one thing in every binding. The event names are the element's (`file-command`);
each framework spells them in its own idiom.

| Element prop   | React / Solid / Vanilla | Vue prop       | Angular input  | Svelte prop    |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `fileName`     | `fileName`              | `fileName`     | `fileName`     | `fileName`     |
| `reviewAuthor` | `reviewAuthor`          | `reviewAuthor` | `reviewAuthor` | `reviewAuthor` |
| `themeColors`  | `themeColors`           | `themeColors`  | `themeColors`  | `themeColors`  |

`fileName`, `reviewAuthor` and `themeColors` are forwarded when the prop is set or changes, so a
rename made by File > Open is not reverted by a re-render that passes the old name.

| Element event      | React / Solid / Vanilla option | Vue event          | Angular output    | Svelte callback     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| `file-command`     | `onFileCommand(event)`         | `file-command`     | `fileCommand`     | `onfilecommand`     |
| `document-warning` | `onDocumentWarning(message)`   | `document-warning` | `documentWarning` | `ondocumentwarning` |
| `readonly-change`  | `onReadOnlyChange(readOnly)`   | `readonly-change`  | `readOnlyChange`  | `onreadonlychange`  |
| `ribbon-action`    | `onRibbonAction(detail)`       | `ribbon-action`    | `ribbonAction`    | `onribbonaction`    |
| `ribbon-customize` | `onRibbonCustomize(ids)`       | `ribbon-customize` | `ribbonCustomize` | `onribboncustomize` |

`file-command` is the one cancelable event, so its handler receives the event itself rather than
its detail. Call `event.preventDefault()` to take a File command over (Save, Open, New and so on);
`event.detail.command` says which one. The Vue, Angular and Svelte handlers receive the same
`CustomEvent` object. The other events pass their detail directly.
