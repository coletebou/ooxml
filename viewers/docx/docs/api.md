# Element API and events

Every framework adapter wraps the same `<docx-editor>` custom element. The adapters forward these properties and re-emit these events in their framework's idiom (see [framework bindings](/bindings)).

## Attributes and properties

| Property         | Attribute         | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `documentModel`  |                   | The `DocumentModel` shown. Assigning it is an external replacement, not an edit event.                                            |
| `readOnly`       | `read-only`       | Blocks local edits. Remote collaboration batches still apply.                                                                     |
| `locale`         | `locale`          | Interface language: `en`, `fr`, `de`, `es` or `zh-CN`. Document content is never translated.                                      |
| `fileName`       | `file-name`       | Name of the open document (default `Document1.docx`).                                                                             |
| `reviewAuthor`   | `review-author`   | Author recorded on tracked changes and comments (default `Author`).                                                               |
| `theme`          | `theme`           | `light`, `dark` or `auto`. See [theming](/theming).                                                                               |
| `themeColors`    |                   | Partial token overrides applied as `--dve-*` custom properties.                                                                   |
| `showThumbnails` | `show-thumbnails` | Left rail of page thumbnails (Print Layout only).                                                                                 |
| `showToolbar`    | `show-toolbar`    | `false` hides the ribbon; the title bar and status bar remain.                                                                    |
| `hiddenActions`  |                   | Ribbon controls to hide by stable id; see the table in [bindings](/bindings).                                                     |
| `ribbonAddIns`   |                   | Tabs the host adds after the built-in ones; see [bindings](/bindings#ribbon-add-in-tabs).                                         |
| `collaboration`  |                   | Declarative collaboration (`DocxCollaborationOptions` or `null`); see [collaboration](/collaboration#the-collaboration-property). |
| `customization`  |                   | Capabilities, host File tab pages and host menu commands; see [Customization](#customization).                                    |
| `dirty` (read)   |                   | True after an edit, false after save, load or `markClean()`.                                                                      |

## Customization

`customization` takes one `WordCustomization` object (the shared contract of `ooxml-core/embedding`, also used by Excel, PowerPoint and Visio). Every binding forwards it as the `customization` prop or input. It is applied when the object identity changes, so keep it stable; `null` restores the defaults.

```ts
editor.customization = {
	capabilities: { print: false, export: false, copy: false },
	backstage: {
		extraPages: [
			{
				id: 'policies',
				label: 'Policies',
				render: (container, context) => {
					container.textContent = `Policies for ${context.fileName}`;
				},
			},
		],
	},
	contextMenu: {
		extraCommands: [
			{ id: 'send', label: 'Send to chat', onSelect: ({ selectedText }) => send(selectedText) },
		],
	},
};
```

| Field                       | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `capabilities`              | `false` removes every path to the capability (`WORD_CAPABILITY_IDS`): `edit` (read-only whatever `readOnly` says), `print`, `export` (Save As, Export), `save`, `open` (New, Open), `share`, `copy` (Copy, Cut, their keys), `comment`, `review` (tracking, accept, reject), `find`, `settings` (File > Options). Ribbon controls, File tab pages, Quick Access Save, context-menu entries, shortcuts and `file-command` all follow. `hiddenActions` is unchanged; the two are unioned. |
| `backstage.extraPages`      | Host File tab pages `{ id, label, group?, order?, render }` after the built-in pages of their group (`footer`: next to Options). `render` is a mount function `(container, context) => cleanup \| { update, destroy }`, a custom element tag, or `{ element, properties }`. The body mounts the first time the page is shown, receives a `WordRegionContext` (`editor`, `fileName`, `locale`, `canEdit`, `close`) and is torn down when the page is removed or the editor disconnects.  |
| `contextMenu.extraCommands` | Host commands `{ id, label, icon?, group?, when?, disabled?, onSelect }` above (`top`, default) or below (`bottom`) the built-in entries. `onSelect` runs after the menu closes, with a `WordMenuContext` (`selectedText`, `from`, `to`, `readOnly`, `inTable`, `onLink`). Labels are shown as given (localise them yourself).                                                                                                                                                          |

`edit: false` is a read-only lock of its own beside the host's `readOnly` and a collaboration `viewer` role: none of them lifts another, and leaving a room keeps it. `readonly-change` reports it in `readOnly` with `locked: false` (only a `viewer` role sets `locked`) and leaves `hostReadOnly` alone, so a binding that mirrors `hostReadOnly` never writes the capability back. Capabilities are UI policy, not document protection. Region replacement (the Options dialog, panes) is not offered for Word yet. All products side by side are mapped in the [embedding guide](https://github.com/ChristopherVR/ooxml/blob/main/docs/embedding.md).

## Methods

| Method                                                | Description                                                                    |

| `reconnectCollaboration()`, `resyncCollaboration()`   | Recover the Yjs connection or request provider state exchange.                 |
| `getPendingCollaboration()`                           | The pending step batch, or `null`.                                             |
| `receiveCollaboration(batch)`                         | Apply an accepted batch from the authority.                                    |
| `stopCollaboration(discardPending?)`                  | Leave the session; pending edits must be acknowledged or explicitly discarded. |
| `publishPresence`, `receivePresence`, `leavePresence` | Transient presence channel; see [collaboration](/collaboration#presence).      |

## Events

All events bubble and are composed, so they cross the shadow boundary.

| Event                  | Detail                               | Meaning                                                                                               |

| `document-change`      | `DocumentModel`                      | The document changed through editing or review actions.                                               |
| `document-error`       | `Error`                              | Loading, saving, printing or an edit failed.                                                          |

| `readonly-change`      | `{ readOnly, locked, hostReadOnly }` | The user toggled Editing/Viewing in the chrome.                                                       |
| `file-command`         | `{ command, fileName? }`             | Cancelable. `command` is `new`, `open`, `save`, `saveAs`, `export`, `exportText`, `print` or `share`. |
| `dirty-change`         | `boolean`                            | Unsaved-changes state flipped.                                                                        |
| `page-change`          | `{ page, pageCount }`                | Print Layout page or page count changed (approximate pagination).                                     |
| `ribbon-action`        | `RibbonAction`                       | A ribbon control was activated.                                                                       |
| `ribbon-customize`     | `readonly string[]`                  | The user changed which ribbon commands are shown; persist the ids if wanted.                          |

| `collaboration-send`   | `StepBatch`                          | Local steps are pending; transport them to the authority.                                             |
| `collaboration-change` | `DocxCollaborationState`             | The collaboration state changed: `{ active, roomId, status, synced, people }`.                        |

The package exports the typed event map (`DocxEditorEventMap`) and the runtime list `DOCX_EDITOR_EVENTS`.

The framework bindings forward the props `fileName`, `reviewAuthor` and `themeColors`, and the events `file-command`, `document-warning`, `readonly-change`, `ribbon-action` and `ribbon-customize`, under their framework names (for example `onFileCommand`, `fileCommand` and `onfilecommand`). The table is in [framework bindings](/bindings#binding-props-and-events).

## Host-owned storage

`storage` (a property of the element and a prop of every binding) takes a `DocumentStorage` from
`ooxml-core/embedding`. When it is set:

- File > Save, Save As and Ctrl+S hand the saved bytes to `storage.save(bytes, meta)` instead of
  downloading them. `meta` is `{ fileName, mimeType, reason }`, with `reason` `'save'` or
  `'saveAs'`. Once it resolves the document is marked saved; if it resolves with `{ fileName }`
  the title bar takes that name. A rejection is reported as `document-error` and the document
  stays dirty.
- File > Open calls `storage.open()` when the storage has one and opens the `{ bytes, fileName }`
  it resolves with (`undefined` means the user canceled). Without `open` the file picker is used.
- One save runs at a time: Save while a save is pending is ignored, not queued. An edit made while
  the host save runs keeps the document dirty, since the saved bytes do not contain it.
- `file-command` still fires first. A host that calls `preventDefault()` handles the command
  itself and `storage` is not called. Save As announces `saveAs` and then `save`.
- A host that removed Save (`customization.capabilities.save: false`) gets neither the `save`
  event nor `storage.save`; Save As (the `export` capability) then only downloads.

Export, Export as text and Print still use the browser. Word has no AutoRecover, so the recovery
methods of `DocumentStorage` are not used.

```ts
editor.storage = {
	async save(bytes, { fileName, mimeType }) {
		await fetch(`/files/${encodeURIComponent(fileName)}`, {
			method: 'PUT',
			headers: { 'content-type': mimeType },
			body: bytes,
		});
	},
};
```
