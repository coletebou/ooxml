# Element API

`<xlsx-editor>` (class `XlsxEditorElement`) is the one editor every package mounts. Register it with `defineXlsxEditor()` (exported by every package; registration is idempotent and does nothing without `customElements`), or let `mountEditor` and the framework components do it for you.

```ts
import { defineXlsxEditor } from 'xlsx-vanilla-viewer';

defineXlsxEditor();
const editor = document.createElement('xlsx-editor');
editor.fileName = 'Budget.xlsx';
document.body.append(editor);
await editor.load(bytes, 'Budget.xlsx');
```

| `themeColors`        | `Partial<Record<...>>`               | Token overrides applied as `--xve-*` custom properties ([theming](/theming)).          |
| `hiddenActions`      | `string[]`                           | Ribbon controls, title-bar items and context-menu entries to hide, by stable id.       |

| `customization`      | `ExcelCustomization \| null`         | Capabilities, host File tab pages and host menu commands ([below](#customization)).    |

## Customization

`customization` takes one `ExcelCustomization` object, the shared contract of `ooxml-core/embedding` that Word, PowerPoint and Visio take too. Every binding forwards it as the `customization` prop or input. It is applied when the object identity changes, so keep it stable; `null` restores the defaults.

```ts
editor.customization = {
	capabilities: { print: false, export: false, copy: false },
	backstage: { extraPages: [{ id: 'policies', label: 'Policies', render: 'acme-policies' }] },
	contextMenu: {
		extraCommands: [{ id: 'send', label: 'Send range', onSelect: ({ ref }) => send(ref) }],
	},
};
```

| Field                       | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `capabilities`              | `false` removes every path to the capability (`EXCEL_CAPABILITY_IDS`): `edit` (read-only whatever `readOnly` says), `open` (New, Open), `save`, `export` (Save As, Export), `print`, `share`, `settings` (Options), `copy` (Copy, Cut), `comment` (New and Delete Comment) and `find` (Find, Replace). The commands are hidden through the same registry as `hiddenActions` (ribbon, Tell me, context menus, shortcuts, title bar) and refuse to run, and their File tab pages go. `hiddenActions` is unchanged; the two are unioned. |
| `backstage.extraPages`      | Host File tab pages `{ id, label, group?, order?, render }` after the built-in pages of their group. `render` is a mount function `(container, context) => cleanup \| { update, destroy }`, a custom element tag or `{ element, properties }`; it mounts the first time the page is shown, receives an `ExcelRegionContext` (`editor`, `fileName`, `locale`, `canEdit`, `activeSheet`, `close`) and is torn down when the page is removed or the editor disconnects.                                                                  |
| `contextMenu.extraCommands` | Host commands `{ id, label, icon?, group?, when?, disabled?, onSelect }` in the cell, row header, column header and sheet-tab menus, above (`top`, default) or below (`bottom`) the built-in entries. `onSelect` runs after the menu closes with an `ExcelMenuContext` (`menu`: `cell`, `row`, `column` or `sheetTab`; `sheet`, `sheetName`, `ref`, `active`, `readOnly`); use `when` to offer a command in some menus only. Labels are shown as given.                                                                               |

`edit: false` is a read-only lock of its own beside the host's `readOnly` and a collaboration `viewer` role: none of them lifts another, and leaving a room keeps it. `readonly-change` reports it in `readOnly` with `locked: false` (only a `viewer` role sets `locked`) and leaves `hostReadOnly` alone, so a binding that mirrors `hostReadOnly` never writes the capability back. Capabilities are UI policy, not workbook protection. Region replacement (the Options dialog, panes) is not offered for Excel yet. All products side by side are mapped in the [embedding guide](https://github.com/ChristopherVR/ooxml/blob/main/docs/embedding.md).

| `undo()`, `redo()`            | `void`                | While shared, only this window's edits are undone.                                                                              |

## Events

All events are `CustomEvent`s that bubble and cross the shadow boundary (`composed`).

| Event                  | `detail`                                                                                   | Notes                                                                                 |

| `selection-change`     | `{ sheet, ref, active }`                                                                   | `ref` is the selected range, `active` the active cell.                                |
| `sheet-change`         | `{ index, name }`                                                                          |                                                                                       |
| `dirty-change`         | `{ dirty }`                                                                                |                                                                                       |
| `office-ribbon-add-in` | `{ tab, command }`                                                                         | A command of a host tab (`ribbonAddIns`) was chosen.                                  |

| `validation-error`     | `{ message, title?, ref, style? }`                                                         | A cell edit in progress failed validation and stays open until corrected or canceled. |

The framework bindings forward `file-command`, `workbook-warning`, `ribbon-action` and `sheet-change` as well (for example `onFileCommand`, `fileCommand` and `onfilecommand`); see [framework bindings](/bindings#callbacks-and-events).

```ts
editor.addEventListener('file-command', (event) => {
	if (event.detail.command === 'save') {
		event.preventDefault();
		void editor
			.save()
			.then(uploadToMyStorage)
			.then(() => editor.markClean());
	}
});
```

## Host-owned storage

`storage` (a property of the element and a prop of every binding) takes a `DocumentStorage` from
`ooxml-core/embedding`. When it is set:

- File > Save, Save As and Ctrl+S hand the saved workbook to `storage.save(bytes, meta)` instead of
  downloading it. `meta` is `{ fileName, mimeType, reason }`, with `reason` `'save'` or `'saveAs'`;
  `.xls` and `.csv` sources are saved as `.xlsx`, as a download is. Once it resolves the workbook
  is marked clean; if it resolves with `{ fileName }` the title bar takes that name. A rejection is
  reported as `workbook-error` and the workbook stays dirty.
- File > Open calls `storage.open()` when the storage has one and opens the `{ bytes, fileName }`
  it resolves with (`undefined` means the user canceled). Without `open` the file picker is used.
- One save runs at a time: Save while a save is pending is ignored, not queued. An edit made while
  the host save runs keeps the workbook dirty, since the saved bytes do not contain it.
- `file-command` still fires first; a host that calls `preventDefault()` handles the command
  itself and `storage` is not called.

Export, Save as CSV and Print still download or print in the browser. Excel has no AutoRecover,
so the recovery methods of `DocumentStorage` are not used.

```ts
editor.storage = {
	save: (bytes, { fileName }) => myDrive.put(fileName, bytes),
	open: () => myDrive.pick(), // resolves { bytes, fileName } or undefined
};
```

## Shadow parts

The element exposes its regions as CSS shadow parts, for styling with `xlsx-editor::part(grid)` and for tests: `ribbon`, `name-box`, `formula-bar`, `grid`, `sheet-tabs` and `status-bar`.
