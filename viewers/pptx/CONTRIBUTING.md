# Contributing to pptx-viewer

Thanks for wanting to help. This document covers how to get set up, the rules
that are load-bearing (breaking them breaks releases or ships a half-finished
feature), and what reviewers will check on your PR.

Please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) first. Found a security
vulnerability rather than a bug? Do **not** open a public issue: see

## Getting set up

**Prerequisites:** [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (package manager and runtime) and
Node.js 22+. On Windows, the root test runner also needs Bash (for example, Git Bash), including its standard Unix utilities.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChristopherVR/ooxml.git
cd ooxml

bun install
bun run build                # ooxml-core, built first
bun run --cwd src/ui build   # ooxml-ui, which the bindings and demos read from dist
cd viewers/pptx

bun run build      # foundations, bindings, installer, and React demo
bun run test
bun run typecheck        # needs built packages; on a clean checkout use typecheck:fresh
bun run lint
bun run fmt:check
```

The viewer build (`bun run build` in `viewers/pptx`) runs `core -> shared -> locales -> tools -> react -> vue -> angular -> vanilla -> svelte -> cli -> React demo`. Vue, Angular, Vanilla, and Svelte demo production builds are separate scripts in their demo packages. `emf-converter` and `mtx-decompressor` are external npm dependencies.

External contributors work on a fork: fork ChristopherVR/ooxml, branch off
`main`, and open a PR back to `ChristopherVR/ooxml:main`. (Maintainers with
write access commit directly to `main`; the repository is trunk-based
internally.) The PowerPoint viewer lives in `viewers/pptx` of that repository;
the repository-wide rules are in its root [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md),
and this file adds what is specific to the viewer.

---

## The parity rule (read this before writing UI code)

This project ships **the same viewer/editor through five bindings**:

| Package            | npm name              | Framework |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --------- |
| `packages/react`   | `pptx-react-viewer`   | React     |
| `packages/vue`     | `pptx-vue-viewer`     | Vue 3     |
| `packages/angular` | `pptx-angular-viewer` | Angular   |
| `packages/svelte`  | `pptx-svelte-viewer`  | Svelte 5  |
| `packages/vanilla` | `pptx-vanilla-viewer` | Plain DOM |

A user on Svelte is entitled to exactly the feature set a user on React gets.
Divergence between bindings is the single most expensive kind of debt in this
repo, so parity is a **merge requirement**, not a nice-to-have.

### If you are adding a UI feature

**It must land in all five bindings in the same PR.**

A new ribbon control, dialog, inspector panel, context-menu entry, keyboard
shortcut, gesture, or on-canvas affordance is not "done" when it works in React.
The expected shape of the change is:

1. **Logic goes in the shared layer first** (`src/ui/src/pptx/render/...` at the
   repository root, published as `ooxml-ui/pptx`; document logic goes in
   `src/core/pptx/`). Geometry, style/colour resolution, text
   and paragraph building, chart maths, connector routing, animation, export
   data, state machines, command definitions: none of that is
   framework-specific.
2. **Each binding imports the shared module** and adds only its view layer:
   JSX / SFC template / Angular template / Svelte markup / DOM construction,
   plus the thin reactive wiring.
3. **Add tests in every binding** (see [Testing](#testing)), plus a
   framework-neutral e2e spec so the feature is proven in all five demos.
4. **Add i18n keys for every locale** if the feature has user-visible copy
   (see below).

Reimplementing the same pure helper five times will be sent back. If you find
yourself copy-pasting logic from `packages/react` into `packages/vue`, that
logic belongs in `src/ui/src/pptx/render/`.

### If you are fixing a UI bug

**Check whether the same defect exists in the other four bindings, and say so in
the PR.**

Most UI bugs in this repo are structural: they came from a shared module, or
from four bindings independently making the same mistake while porting from the
React reference. A fix in one binding usually applies to the rest.

Your PR description must answer, explicitly:

- Which bindings did you actually check for this bug?
- Which ones were affected?
- Are they all fixed here? If not, **why**, and where is the tracking issue?

Fix every affected binding in the same PR where practical. If one is genuinely
blocked (an upstream framework limitation, a much larger refactor), that is
fine, but file an issue and link it. Silently fixing one binding is what causes
the drift.

### Decision table

| Change                                           | Where the logic lives | Bindings to touch       | Tests required                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| New UI feature (control, dialog, panel, gesture) | `src/ui/src/pptx`     | **All five**            | Unit per binding + shared unit + e2e spec               |
| UI fix reproducible in >1 binding                | `src/ui/src/pptx`     | **All affected**        | Regression test per affected binding (+ e2e)            |
| UI fix genuinely specific to one framework       | That binding          | Just that one           | Regression test in that binding; PR says why            |
| Parsing / serialization / geometry               | `pptx-viewer-core`    | None (bindings inherit) | Unit in `ooxml-core` (pptx area), round-trip if on save |
| Docs, README, examples                           | n/a                   | n/a                     | Documentation build and relevant example checks         |

"Genuinely specific to one framework" means something like Angular change
detection, Svelte 5 runes, or a React `useEffect` ordering issue. A wrong
colour, a mis-clipped shape, an off-by-one in a drag handle, or a dialog that
does not open is almost never framework-specific.

### i18n

Adding an English key to `src/ui/src/pptx/i18n/translations-en.ts` (and its `translations-en-*.ts` siblings) requires
matching entries under `packages/locales/src/{de,es,fr,zh-CN}/`.
`packages/locales/src/locales.test.ts` fails the test suite if any locale is missing
a canonical key. Never hardcode a user-visible string: route it through
`t()` / `translate`.

---

## Where code belongs

```
packages/
  core/      pptx-viewer-core     Parse, edit, serialize PPTX (framework-agnostic)
  shared/    pptx-viewer-shared   Compatibility facade (PRIVATE); owns no logic, which lives in src/ui/src/pptx
  locales/   pptx-viewer-locales  de/es/fr/zh-CN dictionaries (PRIVATE)
  react/     pptx-react-viewer    React binding
  vue/       pptx-vue-viewer      Vue 3 binding
  angular/   pptx-angular-viewer  Angular binding
  vanilla/   pptx-vanilla-viewer  Zero-framework binding
  svelte/    pptx-svelte-viewer   Svelte 5 binding
  tools/     pptx-viewer-mcp      MCP server / tooling
  cli/       @christophervr/pptx-viewer
```

Rules of thumb:

- **PPTX in / PPTX out** goes in `core`. Anything about the OpenXML file itself:
  parsing, theme resolution, geometry presets, serialization, round-trip.
- **How the deck behaves** goes in the shared UI layer (`src/ui/src/pptx`). Anything a viewer needs but that
  does not care which framework renders it.
- **How the deck looks in this framework** goes in the binding, and should be
  thin. A component that declares its own interfaces or does non-trivial
  computation is a smell: move that into a shared module or a composable.

`pptx-viewer-shared` is **private and never published**, and it is only a
compatibility facade over `ooxml-ui/pptx`. The framework-independent renderer
and web components live in `src/ui/src/pptx` at the repository root; document
logic lives in `src/core/pptx`. After changing either, run `bun run build` in
that package (`src/ui` or `src/core`) before the demos that read `dist` will see
it.

---

## Testing

Every PR should carry tests proportional to the parity table above.

```bash
bun run test                       # vitest across all packages
cd packages/react && bun run test  # a single package
bun run e2e                        # Playwright, all five demo projects
bun run e2e -- --project=svelte    # a single framework
bun run e2e:install                # one-time Playwright browser install
```

After building the packages, run `bun run test:core-package` and
`bun run test:binding-packages` to check isolated npm consumers. The core check
loads ESM and CommonJS entries, compiles public TypeScript imports, and exports
then reloads a legacy PPT. The binding check packs all five bindings, applies
the release manifest resolver, installs them outside the workspace, and imports
their ESM and advertised CommonJS entries. CI runs both checks after their
required builds; production-demo Playwright tests cover browser behaviour.

### What CI runs on your PR

CI is **scoped to the paths you changed** (`scripts/affected-packages.mjs`), so a
PR touching only `packages/vue` runs the Vue legs rather than all seventeen. The
scoping deliberately errs towards running more: a change to `core` or `shared`
fans out to every binding, and any path it does not recognise runs everything.
Pushes to `main` are never scoped.

**Playwright does not run on pull requests from forks.** It needs a dev server
and a browser per framework and is by far the slowest part of the pipeline, so
it runs on the push to `main` after merge instead. A maintainer can force the
full sweep on your PR by adding the `full-ci` label, and will do so for anything
touching rendering, layout, or presentation behaviour.

That means a green tick on a fork PR is not proof the e2e suite passes. Run the
suite locally for UI work:

```bash
bun run e2e -- --project=vue
```

### Unit tests

Colocated with source, `.test.ts` suffix. Vitest.

### e2e tests

Playwright specs live in `e2e/pptx/` at the repository root. **Product specs must be framework-neutral**:
one spec runs against all five demos, selected by Playwright project. This is
enforced by a contract check that runs as part of `bun run e2e`:

```bash
bun run e2e:contract   # scripts/check-e2e-neutrality.mjs
```

It rejects specs that hardcode a demo port (4173-4177) or a framework-specific
selector (`pptx-react-*`, `pptx-ng-*`, `pptxv`, and so on) outside of a
project-conditional branch. `e2e/pptx/ribbon-tab-parity.spec.ts` is the reference for
how a legitimately framework-aware comparison is written.

Specs prefixed `capture-` are documentation asset generators, not product tests,
and are exempt.

**A UI feature PR without an e2e spec is how a binding quietly falls behind.**
If a feature is worth adding to five bindings, it is worth one neutral spec.

### `@local-only` e2e tests

A small number of specs do real-time video capture (`MediaRecorder` over
`canvas.captureStream()`) that reliably takes down the whole hosted CI runner
(exit 143, "the runner has received a shutdown signal") rather than merely
failing, and cannot be reproduced outside that environment. Those tests carry
the Playwright tag `{ tag: '@local-only' }` and are excluded from CI via
`grepInvert` in `playwright.config.ts`; see `e2e/pptx/export-raster-tiling.spec.ts`
for the current tagged tests and the incident history in their comments.

They still run locally:

```bash
bun run e2e:local-only   # playwright test --grep @local-only --workers=1
```

Run them yourself before pushing a change to export-video-related paths (the
shared export pipeline, each binding's export code, or the tagged spec itself):
the `.husky/pre-push` hook in `viewers/pptx` is inert in this monorepo (see the
root `AGENTS.md`), so nothing else covers CI's blind spot.

Do not add `@local-only` to a test unless it is genuinely unrunnable on the
hosted runner, not merely slow; a normal slow test belongs in the regular
suite with a longer timeout instead.

## Documentation

The VitePress site in `docs/` is separate from the root Bun workspace. See
[the documentation maintenance guide](docs/README.md) for setup, validation,
translation coverage, and generated release pages. Documentation changes should
be checked against public exports and source types, then built with
`bun run docs:build`.

## Running the demos

```bash
bun run demo           # React     :4173
bun run demo:angular   # Angular   :4174
bun run demo:vue       # Vue 3     :4175
bun run demo:vanilla   # VanillaJS :4176
bun run demo:svelte    # Svelte 5  :4177
```

The Vanilla and Svelte demos serve `e2e/pptx/fixtures` as their public dir; the other demos use their default `public/` directory. The landing page's
"or create a New Presentation" button gives you an editable deck without needing
a file.

### Read this before debugging a demo

The demos do **not** all resolve packages the same way, and the difference
decides whether your edit is live on reload or needs a build first.

| Specifier                     | react      | vue        | angular    | vanilla    | svelte     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| the binding (`pptx-*-viewer`) | source     | source     | **`dist`** | source     | source     |
| `pptx-viewer-core`            | source     | source     | **`dist`** | source     | source     |
| `ooxml-ui/pptx`               | **`dist`** | source     | **`dist`** | source     | source     |
| `pptx-viewer-locales`         | source     | source     | **`dist`** | source     | source     |
| `pptx-viewer-mcp`             | **`dist`** | **`dist`** | **`dist`** | **`dist`** | **`dist`** |

Anything marked `dist` resolves to built output, so **source edits are invisible
until you build that package**:

- **Angular** reads `packages/angular/dist` (ng-packagr). Editing
  `packages/angular/src` changes nothing on screen until you run `bun run build`
  in `packages/angular`. Core also resolves to built output in this demo: run
  `bun run --filter pptx-viewer-core build` after core changes. Shared UI edits
  need a build in `src/ui` at the repository root first. This is the most common way to waste an hour concluding
  "my change does not work in Angular".
- **`pptx-viewer-mcp`** is aliased by no demo but is imported by
  `src/ui/src/pptx/ai/tools/mcp-registry.ts`, so a stale
  `packages/tools/dist` **breaks all five demos at once** with
  `Module "path" has been externalized for browser compatibility`. The giveaway
  is a demo that renders only its version footer. Fix with `bun run build` in
  `packages/tools`.
- After adding a **new export to `ooxml-ui/pptx`**, build `src/ui` once or the
  React and Angular demos will not see it.

Two more traps:

- **Zombie Vite servers** keep serving stale code after a refactor. Check with
  `netstat -ano | findstr ":4173 :4174 :4175 :4176 :4177"` (or `lsof -i` on
  Unix) and kill the PID rather than debugging code that is not running.
- **Stale Vite dep caches** produce bogus framework-internal stack traces.
  Delete the demo's `node_modules/.vite` and restart before believing a trace
  that points inside Svelte, Angular, or Vue itself.

## Commit conventions

Commits **must** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
This is load-bearing, not cosmetic: each package is versioned and released
independently, and **the bump level is derived from your commit type**. A
mislabelled commit mis-versions a published package, and a non-conforming commit
is silently dropped from the changelog.

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

- **type**: `feat` (minor bump), `fix` / `perf` / `refactor` / `docs` / `test` /
  `build` / `ci` / `style` / `chore` / `revert` (patch bump). A `!` after the
  type/scope or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer bumps major.
- **scope**: the package or area: `core`, `react`, `vue`, `angular`, `svelte`,
  `vanilla`, `shared`, `tools`, `cli`, `ci`, `deps`.
- **subject**: imperative, lower-case, no trailing period, first line under
  ~72 chars.

Which package a commit versions is decided by the **paths it touches**, so keep
a commit within one package where practical. A parity PR spanning five bindings
is best split into one commit per binding plus one for `shared`.

Examples: `feat(core): typed xml-access helpers`,
`fix(react): remove dead table-cell comparisons`,
`fix(vue): apply the same clip-path fix as react`.

---

## Code style

Formatting and linting come from the [oxc](https://oxc.rs) toolchain:

```bash
bun run fmt        # oxfmt, writes
bun run fmt:check  # CI-safe
bun run lint       # oxlint
bun run lint:fix
```

A `lint-staged` pre-commit hook runs on commit. Two things it will not catch:

- **It skips `.vue` files.** Its glob covers only js/ts extensions, so an oxlint
  warning inside an SFC sails through the hook and fails `bun run lint` in CI.
  Lint Vue changes explicitly before pushing.
- **It does not catch em-dashes.** See below.

House rules:

- **No `any`.** Use concrete types, `unknown` plus narrowing, or the `XmlObject`
  alias for parsed XML.
- **Keep every source file at or under ~300 LOC** (tests excluded). When a file
  approaches the limit, split it: extract pure logic into a focused module, lift
  sub-views into their own components. Prefer many small single-purpose files.
- **Barrel exports.** Every directory has an `index.ts`; import from barrels.
- **Narrow `PptxElement` on the `type` discriminant**, e.g.
  `if (element.type === "image")`.
- **EMU units.** PowerPoint measures in English Metric Units; constants live in
  `core/constants.ts` (`EMU_PER_INCH = 914400`, `EMU_PER_POINT = 12700`,
  `EMU_PER_PIXEL = 9525`).
- **No em-dashes.** Never write U+2014 anywhere: source, comments, JSDoc,
  docs, commit messages, or UI copy. Use a colon, comma, semicolon, parentheses,
  or a spaced hyphen. The only exception is functional content that
  intentionally renders or asserts the character.
- **File naming**: kebab-case for utilities, PascalCase for classes.

## Opening a pull request

Before you push:

```bash
bun run lint && bun run fmt:check && bun run typecheck && bun run test
bun run typecheck:fresh  # instead of typecheck when packages are not built yet
bun run e2e          # if you touched anything user-visible
```

Fill in the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) honestly. The parity
section is the part reviewers read first: if you touched UI, tell us which
bindings you checked, not just which ones you changed.

What gets a PR sent back, in rough order of frequency:

1. A UI feature or fix in one binding with no statement about the other four.
2. Pure logic duplicated into a binding instead of extracted to `shared`.
3. A non-conforming commit message (it will mis-version a release).
4. New English i18n keys with no `de`/`es`/`fr`/`zh-CN` entries.
5. A source file pushed well past 300 LOC instead of split.
6. Em-dashes.

Questions are welcome: open an issue or a draft PR early rather than building
something large in the wrong place.
