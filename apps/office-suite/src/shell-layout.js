 * Decide how the shell chrome adapts to the visible viewport. Pure so the rules are testable;

 *
 * - `narrow`: the actions bar becomes one More button.
 * - `drawer`: the app rail becomes an off-canvas drawer (not in a standalone product, which has no rail).
 * - `hideTabs`: a lone open document on a narrow screen needs no tab strip (the brand returns home),
 *   unless a Teams or Mail tab is open: the strip is the way back to it.
 * - `collapsible`: short editor views may fold the title bar, tabs and actions behind a toggle.
 * - `collapsed`: that fold is currently applied.
