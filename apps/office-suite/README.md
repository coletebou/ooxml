</div>

The deployable Office application workspace (`ooxml-office`), shared by the integrated suite, the standalone PWAs and the desktop package. It mounts the real editors directly, with no demo iframes. Format logic stays in [`ooxml-core`](../../src/core#readme) and reusable controls in [`ooxml-ui`](../../src/ui#readme); this package only wires them together.

## Three ways to open it

The first visit asks where to start:

- **OOXML Office**: every app in one workspace, opening on **Chat**: ask questions about your files, or ask for a document, workbook or deck and open what it drafts in its editor. The shared library, a tab per open document, the app launcher and search sit beside it, and **Ask AI** opens the same chat next to any open document. See [the assistant](../../docs/suite-integration.md) for providers, the offline preview and what it may change. It opens in dark mode; Appearance in the account menu switches it.
- **One product on its own**: [Word](../../viewers/docx#readme), [Excel](../../viewers/xlsx#readme), [PowerPoint](../../viewers/pptx#readme), [Visio](../../viewers/visio#readme), [Teams](../../viewers/teams#readme) or [Notebook](../../viewers/notebook#readme), each on its own site with its documentation and framework demos.
- **Documentation**: the hub at [`/ooxml/docs/`](https://christophervr.github.io/ooxml/docs/) (`site/docs/`), one page that links every manual: the apps, `ooxml-core`, `ooxml-ui`, the MCP server, the suite and the desktop build.

In the browser the sidebar's Resources group links to the documentation and reopens the chooser; an installed app hides the group, since it has no browser chrome to come back through. The look of every page on the site follows [the pages design system](../../docs/pages-design.md).

## Run it

From the repository root:

```sh
bun install
bun run build:suite
bun run preview:suite
```

Output: `suite-dist/`. The root installs Office; `apps/word/`, `apps/excel/`, `apps/powerpoint/`, `apps/visio/`, `apps/teams/` and `apps/notebook/` each install independently. They share local profiles and documents when served from the same origin. Installation is available from the account menu or the browser's install command.

See [integration and limitations](../../docs/suite-integration.md) and [desktop packaging](../../desktop/README.md). This is a private application package, not an npm-published library. Cloud identity, cloud drive and document coauthoring are separate integration work.
