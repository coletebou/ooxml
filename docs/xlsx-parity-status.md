# XLSX parity status

Last reviewed 2026-10-22. This page is the single live status tracker for the Excel product; the
earlier separate Excel review, lookup evidence and implementation-log pages were folded into it
(the per-increment history lives in git). The chart-title and legend increments below were recorded
at `f12ee7ea6` on 8 October 2026, and the test counts quoted further down are from that revision.
Native references, core and browser regressions, and selected Excel reopen checks bound the
implemented scope.

**Full 1:1 Microsoft Excel parity has not been achieved.** The product is a
working spreadsheet editor with substantial supported behavior and an expanding
native comparison corpus. Compatibility is verified for specific cases, not
for every Excel feature, workbook or UI interaction. We have not established
lossless saving or whole-workbook pixel equivalence.

## Current assessment

We have a working spreadsheet editor, with partial compatibility and native
evidence for specific workflows. We do not yet have Excel-equivalent behavior
or UI. A supported feature means its listed scope works; it does not mean all
Excel options, interactions or visual details in that area are implemented.

| Parity dimension               | Assessment   | Evidence or remaining work                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Workbook import and saving     | Partial      | Supported content has round-trip regressions and selected Excel acceptance checks. Unsupported features and structural edits need wider preservation coverage.                                                                                  |
| Editing and calculation        | Partial      | Values, formulas, formatting, clipboard, history and structural editing work within supported scope. Missing functions and semantic edge cases remain.                                                                                          |
| Charts                         | Partial      | Eight SVG families plus combination, waterfall, histogram, bubble, stock, treemap and sunburst and selected formatting/edit/export workflows are tested. Advanced families, complete controls and exact layout remain open.                     |
| SmartArt                       | Display-only | Shared cached drawings render; insertion, editing and reflow are absent.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Excel UI and visual appearance | Partial      | Shared ribbon/gallery/fill controls and six bindings are exercised. Full ribbon/dialog behavior, text/layout and raster equivalence are unverified or incomplete.                                                                               |
| Whole-product parity           | Not achieved | Bounded pivots, partial collaboration and Page Layout / Page Break Preview exist; shared pivot caches, label and value filters, FORECAST.ETS, data connections, macro execution and full print fidelity are missing, which prevents this claim. |

The latest diagram/chart/XLSX and PowerPoint layout-parser sweep passed
**8,591 ordinary tests**, with **17 existing expected raster failures**.
The updated seven-reference title-layout tests and **16 PowerPoint UI layout
checks** also passed. Focused chart browser checks passed **302 unique cases**
across six bindings, including 48 new legend cases. Core/UI typechecks, builds
and package checks passed. The earlier
9,938-test sweep used a broader shared-text filter; these counts have different
scopes.
These counts describe regression coverage, not a completion percentage or a
complete end-to-end Excel comparison.

## Chart-title layout: implemented scope and remaining limits

Imported manual title positions and overlay flags now render and survive
chart type regeneration. Title/plot/legend layout XML and its extensions are
preserved through that path. Seven native references and two MCP-reviewed UI
exports reopened/resaved in Excel verify the selected cases. Title position
parsing and rectangle geometry reuse the PowerPoint implementation through
shared core chart helpers. Manual title dimensions, plot placement rendering,
position authoring controls and full chart geometry remain incomplete.

Automatic chart-title wrapping now uses one shared text-flow helper in XLSX
and the PowerPoint static SVG converter. Words can cross formatting runs;
oversized words split at grapheme boundaries in XLSX. Soft wraps do not alter
the source title or its rich-body XML. Paragraph before/after spacing applies
at the wrapped paragraph edges. The grid retains fractional drawing dimensions
to avoid moving a break when width is rounded to a whole pixel.

Ten independently reopened Excel references cover chart widths from 160 to
480 points, mixed font sizes, an oversized word and paragraph spacing. With
captured Chromium Arial metrics, title widths differ from these native boxes
by less than 2 CSS pixels and heights by less than 4. These bounds are specific
to this corpus. Playwright MCP verified the native 200-point word reference
before/after a type change. Excel reopens, resaves and reopens that export with
the full title and 152.07 by 65.1-point title box unchanged.

Manual title dimensions, autofit, other scripts/fonts and exact title/plot placement
remain unverified or incomplete. The native and browser screenshots still
show different plot geometry and gridline appearance. This is automatic
wrapping support for the tested scope, not full chart or text parity.

| Editing and clipboard         | Finite copies retain trailing blanks; compatible selections tile copied blocks. Directional fills copy content/formatting with translated formulas. Paste Special supports content modes, transpose, Skip Blanks, arithmetic, All Except Borders and column widths. Notes, validation, hyperlinks and supported conditional formats participate in the clipboard path. History, save/reload and structural reference behavior have regressions.                                 | This is not complete Excel clipboard metadata or every cut/paste scenario.

Core tests cover solver cases, tables and a generated openpyxl fixture; browser spec covers Goal Seek and a data table. | Forecast Sheet is disabled (needs FORECAST.ETS). No Scenario Summary or Merge, no Goal Seek Step or Pause, data tables are not shifted by row or column inserts and deletes, and results were not compared against real Excel output.                   |
| Chart selection and structure | Pictures/charts can be selected, moved, resized and deleted. Charts support insertion, family/grouping changes, title and legend changes, history and save/reload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The base SVG families are column, bar, line, area, pie, doughnut, scatter and radar; combination, waterfall, histogram, bubble, stock, treemap and sunburst are drawn as well (see the assessment table). Many native chart options remain unsupported. |
| Chart formatting UI           | Shared Change Colors gallery, individual series fills, bar gap/overlap controls and docked fill panes. No fill, solid, transparency and supported linear/rectangular/circular/shape gradients have authoring paths, stop controls, previews and native presets.

Gradient support varies by chart element/type.                                                                           |
| Chart rendering and export    | Imported styles, supported gradients/shadows, axis visibility, built-in text defaults, chart-wide font inheritance and mixed title runs/lines/paragraphs. Supported fills and text formatting survive tested chart edits and regeneration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Text measurement, wrapping, spacing, automatic/manual layout and full chart raster fidelity remain approximate.

| SmartArt                      | Imported cached drawings render through `office-ui-smartart`; shared theme colors, transforms and font choices improve native appearance. A native Basic Block List reference verifies three labels and measured text properties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Display-only. No insertion, text editing, layout reflow or complete layout/color/style galleries. Without a cached drawing, the viewer lists text in a placeholder.

## Reuse from PowerPoint and other packages

- The chart picker uses `office-ui-gallery`, also used by PowerPoint's ribbon
  gallery. It shares visual tiles, selection, keyboard behavior and theme contracts.
- SmartArt uses the shared `office-ui-smartart` component and format-neutral
  diagram model/color/font resolution. XLSX supplies its workbook theme.
- Chart models, colors, gradients, fills, XML preservation and appearance logic
  live in shared core areas. Mixed titles reuse the DrawingML text reader and
  existing chart/theme resolver, rather than a viewer-specific text parser.
- Series and background formatting panes share fill bindings and controls;
  edits use the existing XLSX transaction, history and save pipelines.
- Chart-title wrapping and PowerPoint static SVG text share `wrapStyledRuns`
  in the core text area. Font resolution and measurement stay with their
  existing product/host implementations.
- Manual chart-layout values and rectangle geometry share one core helper,
  extracted from the PowerPoint parser and renderer. XLSX uses it for imported
  title positions and preserves source layout extensions through regeneration.
- Modern OOXML logic stays in `ooxml-core`; legacy XLS/CFB codecs stay in `ole2`.
  Framework adapters do not contain duplicate spreadsheet engines.

## What the recorded validation proves

The latest completed increment has the regression results listed above:
8,591 ordinary core tests, 17 expected raster failures, 302 focused browser
cases across vanilla, React, Vue, Angular, Svelte and Solid, and passing
core/UI build, type and package checks. These are scoped implementation-run
results, rather than a full-product equivalence suite. Earlier
results had different scopes and are not carried here.

Core tests cover supported parsing, editing, preservation and layout behavior.
Browser tests cover selected painted geometry and actual edit/history/save
flows. Excel COM and native PNG comparisons independently verify selected
references. Passing those layers establishes their tested scope, not every
option of a chart family or every Excel workflow. The 17 expected raster
failures remain unresolved visual differences.

Native evidence uses owned hidden Excel instances, principally Excel 16.0
build 20430. The current chart text corpus includes 96 built-in style
references, 24 chart-wide inheritance/direct-format references and three
mixed-title references. These are independently reopened measurements, with
chart XML retained in test-only fixtures.

Playwright MCP reviewed actual imports, controls and export flows. Recent UI
exports were reopened and resaved through Excel COM, then reopened again. The
mixed-title export retained the font size, name, bold, italic, underline and
color of all 23 measured title characters after a chart type change.

These results establish the tested behavior on that Excel build. They do not
prove every chart type, every workbook, every browser, Excel for Mac/web,
all Microsoft 365 versions or complete UI equivalence. Test counts are not
a parity percentage, and no defensible overall completion percentage exists yet.

## Imported manual legends

Eight native Excel references have been collected for automatic, moved,
overlay, wide and tall legends. They record source XML and native geometry.
The XLSX painter now uses the shared chart rectangle resolver for imported
legend positions and dimensions. The tested wide legends use horizontal
entry flow; tall legends use vertically spaced entries with aligned keys.
Moving a non-overlay legend retains the automatic side reservation, while an
overlay releases that band. Manual/overlay legends paint after the plot.

Core checks retain layout and overlay source XML through type regeneration.
MCP reviewed actual tall/wide workbook imports and a type-change export.
Excel reopens, resaves and reopens the tall Line export with Left=40pt,
Top=100pt, Width=90pt, Height=150pt, Arial 12pt and IncludeInLayout=false.
Native PNG comparisons expose remaining label-spacing and paint differences.
Automatic geometry, multi-row/column packing, entry-specific formatting,
line/marker swatches and position-authoring controls remain incomplete.

## Pivots, slicers and sparklines

- Pivots: bounded authoring and refresh in `src/core/xlsx/pivot/` (aggregation, layouts, report
  filter, native cache XML) with `model-pivots.ts`, and dialogs in `src/ui/src/xlsx`. Up to 16
  measures, any number of row and column fields, tabular/compact/outline layouts, per-field custom
  subtotals, Values on rows, number and date grouping (seconds to years), and date groups together
  with report filters, hidden items, slicers and timelines round trip. Date group names written by
  Excel in another language are read by position and written back unchanged
  (`PivotDateGroup.localized`), checked against fixtures relabelled as a German Excel names them
  because only the English Excel is installed. Other captions Excel localizes (Row Labels, Grand
  Total, Values, subtotal names) are English-only, so a fully localized workbook stays preserved.
  Not supported and kept read-only with warnings (`pivot/admission.ts`): shared caches, label and
  value filters, filters on date group items, mixed or custom layouts. Native acceptance:
  `scripts/xlsx-pivot-acceptance.ps1` and the `xlsx-pivot-*-oracle.ps1` scripts.
- Slicers and timelines: `src/core/xlsx/slicer/` views, `edit/slicers.ts`,
  `scripts/xlsx-slicer-acceptance.ps1`.
- Sparklines: line, column and win/loss groups are drawn and authored (create, format, clear, with
  an Insert ribbon group; `edit/sparklines.ts`, `scripts/xlsx-sparkline-acceptance.ps1`). Excel
  ignores the extension if its URI uses uppercase `4FD2`, so the writer uses lowercase `4fd2`;
  edits to revision-tagged groups need a distinct revision UID, which the commands supply. Style
  galleries, grouping/ungrouping, date-axis authoring and individual source-range editing remain;
  existing date-axis metadata is preserved.

## Calculation: lookups and regular expressions

- Lookups: exact and approximate XMATCH/XLOOKUP keep the full reference extent, compare across
  value types (numbers, text, logicals, blanks) and follow native duplicate positions in binary
  search; MATCH/VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP reject scalar tables; omitted-argument defaults for XMATCH,
  ADDRESS, INDIRECT and OFFSET follow one shared call policy; INDIRECT supports R1C1 with whole
  rows/columns and wrapping (`address-r1c1.ts`). Evidence: 216 recorded comparisons
  (`formula/__fixtures__/lookup-native.json`, `lookup-native.test.ts`, recorded by
  `scripts/record-xlsx-lookups.ps1` on Excel 16.0 build 20430). Binary search requires the declared
  sort order; arbitrary unsorted input is not established.
- Regular expressions: `REGEXEXTRACT` implements return modes 0 (first match), 1 (all matches,
  vertical spill) and 2 (capture groups, horizontal spill); an invalid mode or pattern is
  `#VALUE!`, no match is `#N/A`. Patterns are JavaScript regular expressions, so PCRE2-only syntax
  is unsupported, and the installed Excel returned `#NAME?`, so it could not validate them.
- Functions: odd-period bond pricing (`odd-securities.ts`) and Bessel functions (`bessel.ts`)
  exist; `FORECAST.ETS` is still missing, which keeps Forecast Sheet disabled. Native fixtures cover
  AMORLINC, DB and DDB (`scripts/record-xlsx-amorlinc.ps1`, `record-xlsx-depreciation.ps1`).

## Import, print and collaboration

- Import: `load/detect.ts` identifies XLSB so it can be refused with a message; ODS is not
  supported; legacy `.xls` and CSV load through `xlsx/load`. External connections use cached
  values; VBA is carried but never executed; add-ins and Power Query are not implemented.
- Print: paginated preview and print fields support saved page setup and header/footer fields
  with font family/size, RGB colour, bold, italic, underline and strike (native PDF checks:
  `scripts/xlsx-print-acceptance.ps1`, `xlsx-print-format-acceptance.ps1`). Theme colours, images,
  page offsets, double underline and super/subscript are outside preview support.
- Collaboration: `ooxml-core/xlsx/collab` maps the workbook to Yjs (cell values and formulas,
  formats, row heights, column widths, merges, sheet add/rename/move/delete/state/tab colour,
  defined names, selections; row and column inserts travel as the resulting cell moves), and
  `<xlsx-editor>` is wired (share dialog, presence). Not shared yet: charts, drawings, images,
  comments, hyperlinks, conditional formats, validations, tables, filters, pivots, freeze panes
  and views, page setup, protection and document properties. See [collab-area.md](collab-area.md).
- Clipboard: finite copies keep trailing blanks and tile into compatible selections; directional
  fills translate formulas; Paste Special supports content modes, transpose, Skip Blanks,
  arithmetic, All Except Borders and column widths; notes, validation, hyperlinks and supported
  conditional formats travel (`edit/clipboard.ts`; native recordings `record-xlsx-paste-*.ps1`).
  Clipboard payloads are dense arrays and whole-row/column copies are bounded to used content.

## Major work still required

1. Native chart text measurement, wrapping, spacing, title/legend placement and
   overall chart geometry, followed by wider screenshot/raster comparisons.
2. Complete chart formatting/authoring UI, advanced families, axes, labels,
   effects and style/layout behavior, with native edit/export comparisons.
3. SmartArt insertion, text editing, reflow and shared layout/color/style UI.
4. Broader workbook save fidelity across structural edits, unsupported parts,
   drawings, tables, external links and metadata. No blanket lossless claim.
5. Grid/font/number-format/layout edge cases and native paginated printing.
   Page Layout view and Page Break Preview are implemented (page plan, rulers,
   header/footer editing, break and print-area dragging, saved in
   `sheetView/@view`); still missing there are Custom Views, copy and paste
   inside Page Layout view,
   separate per-view zoom attributes, and native-printer metrics.
6. Pivots beyond the bounded profiles (label and value filters, shared caches, filters on date
   group items, report captions in other languages), sparkline style galleries, grouping and
   individual source-range editing, data connections, and the sheet parts the collaboration
   mapping does not share yet (see "Import, print and collaboration").
7. Wider formula and clipboard differential coverage. VBA execution, add-ins,
   Power Query and unsupported file formats also prevent whole-product parity.

## Completion criteria

Parity remains an active objective. Each feature needs evidence for import,
rendering, editing, undo/redo, save/reopen in Excel and the actual UI workflow,
using representative native fixtures and explicit unsupported cases. Visual
parity needs measured geometry and raster comparisons, not just matching XML
or SVG attributes. Full parity cannot be declared while any required feature
is missing, unverified or covered only by a narrower comparison.
