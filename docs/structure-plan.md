# Structure and parity plan (2026-10-08)

Where the repository stands after a full survey, and the order of work toward
one shared implementation per Office concept, shared UI bindings, and honest
Office 365 parity. Facts below come from reading the tree on 2026-10-08
(`origin/main` d9ef4e0); counts are approximate and sections 1 to 3 are that
snapshot.

**Status on 2026-10-22.** Waves 1 to 4 landed and the viewers now live in this repository, so the
separate-repository observations (version pins, repository names) in section 1.2 are historical.
Since the snapshot: the duplicate digests, the slow modify-verifier and the missing MD5, RIPEMD and
WHIRLPOOL digests are fixed (`digest` computes them; bugs 1 and 6); the elbow connector geometry
duplicate is gone (the pptx renderer imports `ooxml-core/geometry`); `drawingml/write-theme.ts`
exists; the shared backstage, find bar and print preview live in `src/ui/src/chrome`; continuous
section column balancing exists (`docx/layout/balance-columns.ts`, bug 4); editable Word Print
Layout, Word chart drawing, Excel pivots, Page Layout and collaboration, and Visio collaboration
landed (see the parity pages). `niceScale` is still in `chart/render/chart-scale.ts` next to
`chart/axis-nice.ts`, pinned equal by `xlsx/layout/chart-scale-vs-axis-nice.test.ts`. Wave 5 below is
the open list.

## 1. State

Health at the snapshot: `bun run typecheck` passed (strict and pptx projects) and the core vitest
suite passed except two `modify-verifier*` tests that timed out (section 3, bug 1, since fixed).

Size (non-test lines): `src/core/pptx` ~320k, `src/ui/src/pptx` ~195k,
`src/core/xlsx` ~49k, `src/core/visio` ~36k, `src/ui/src/docx` ~27k,
`src/core/docx` ~24k, `src/ui/src/xlsx` ~19k. The shared areas together are
under 30k, most of it geometry tables.

### 1.2 Bindings

- docx, xlsx and visio each have a `bindings` package with one imperative
  mount factory and thin framework glue. Teams has none: every framework
  repeats the same ~40-line lifecycle. pptx hand-rolls each framework root
  (React 1.7k, Vue 2.3k, Angular 3.9k, vanilla 2.1k lines).
- Drift found: pptx `showToolbar`, `initialSlide`, `showThumbnails` exist in
  svelte and vanilla only; docx Svelte exposes `isDirty()` and no `element`
  where the others expose `dirty` and `element`; xlsx Svelte exposes
  `getElement()`; visio accepts `aria-label` in React only; teams accepts
  `className` in React only; the teams `open-file` payload shape differs per
  framework; `pptx-viewer-shared` pins `ooxml-ui ^0.30.1` while the bindings
  pin `^0.31.0`; visio framework packages import `../../bindings/src/...`
  relatively instead of declaring the dependency.
- The pptx changelog shows the same bug fixed five times, once per binding
  (SmartArt fill opacity, ribbon popups, locale re-translation): the cost of
  having no shared binding layer.

### 1.3 Documentation and configuration drift

Resolved in Waves 1 and 2 (2026-10-08):

- `AGENTS.md`: the PowerPoint row of the "Where does my change go?" table, the
  package names and the status line were corrected (Wave 1 item 8).
- `viewers/xlsx/docs/features.md` now names the labelled-frame chart families,
  states that chart-style authoring is unsupported and takes its function count
  (481) from the registry (Wave 1 item 8).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: the `lint` job no longer waits on `typecheck.ui`
  (Wave 1 item 8).
- `src/ui/tsconfig.pptx.json` extends the base (Wave 2).
- The Playwright Chromium helper is shared by docx and xlsx (Wave 2).
  `tsconfig.release.json` is still duplicated between them.
- Every viewer typecheck is green (Wave 2).
- Four of the five `.oxfmtrc.json` copies were dropped on 2026-10-08 (docx,
  teams, visio and xlsx only restated the root settings).

Still open:

- `.oxfmtrc.json`: the pptx viewer keeps its own copy (it spells out every
  option and adds `ignorePatterns` for `dist/` and minified files); fold those
  into the root config before removing it.
- `src/ui` `sideEffects` lists only the pptx entry.
- The `pptx/*` and `pptx/editor/*` wildcard exports resolve to fixed bundler
  lists that differ between tsup and tsdown.
- 306 of 4,378 non-test modules under `src/` exceed 300 lines (recounted on
  2026-10-08; tests, fixtures and declaration files excluded).

## 2. Target structure

The direction in `agnostic-core-plan.md` stands. The additions below come from
the survey.

1. **`drawingml` area** (new): neutral `DrawingColor` and resolver, fill,
   line, effect and text-body models with DOM parsers and writers, and a
   neutral theme model (colour scheme, font scheme, format scheme, `phClr`).
   The provisional files in `diagram/` move here unchanged. docx, xlsx and
   visio consume it first (they are already on the shared DOM); pptx follows
   through adapters as it leaves `fast-xml-parser`.
2. **`chart` grows a model**: `c:chartSpace` and `cx:` types, DOM parsers and
   writers, a renderer-neutral view model. The xlsx reader and writer become
   the first client, pptx `types/chart.ts` aliases it, and docx gains chart
   loading. One SVG painter for xlsx and the pptx DOM renderer follows.
3. **`digest` owns every hash** Office uses on protection and verifier
   elements, synchronously. `crypto` keeps encryption key derivation.
4. **`i18n` area** (new, DOM-free): locale normalisation, dotted-key
   dictionary merge, translator factory with English fallback. Every product
   UI uses it; visio and teams get dictionaries.
5. **`opc/properties` for every format**: the pptx updater becomes an adapter.
6. **Shared UI**: product UIs build on the `chrome/`, `form/`, `menu/` and
   `presence/` primitives and `--office-*` tokens; the per-product bridges
   shrink to a token alias sheet; one registration contract.
7. **Bindings**: one `bindings` package per product with a mount factory
   (teams gets one; pptx gets a factory for options, events and handle, with
   the view code behind it), one handle vocabulary across products
   (`element`, `dirty`, `load`, `save`), and a per-binding parity test that
   diffs the prop, event and handle lists against the shared contract.
8. **Honest parity ledgers**: each product keeps one capability ledger
   (`viewers/<p>/docs/parity.md` or `features.md`) that the parity reviews
   update, with native-reference evidence per row. No parity percentage.

## 3. Outstanding bugs

1. **Resolved.** Modify-password verification took over 30 s
   (`src/core/pptx/core/utils/modify-verifier-codec.ts`): `iteratedHash`
   awaited `crypto.subtle.digest` 100,000 times. It now uses the synchronous
   `digest/password-hash.ts` spin.
2. **Autosave recovery snapshot missing in a binding**:
   `e2e/pptx/autosave-recovery-prompt.spec.ts` (lines 226, 271) and
   `autosave-recovery-encryption.spec.ts` (203) skip when a binding "never
   wrote a recovery snapshot (no dirty flag)". Root cause to find and fix in
   the shared layer, with per-binding tests.
3. **Known gradient raster gaps** pinned as expected failures:
   `e2e/xlsx/chart-gradient-raster.spec.ts`, `chart-series-path-raster.spec.ts`,
   `src/core/chart/gradient-raster.test.ts` (three-transparent-stop and
   coincident-angle cases).
4. **Mostly resolved.** Continuous section balancing after multi-column
   sections started a new page; `src/core/docx/layout/page-flow.ts` now balances
   columns through `balance-columns.ts`. Floats and footnotes in balanced
   sections were not re-verified.
5. **Drift listed in 1.2 and 1.3** (each item is a bug for one binding or one
   reader of the docs).
6. **Resolved.** `digest` now computes MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD-128/160 and WHIRLPOOL
   (the pptx copy was moved into it), so Excel and Word protection with those
   digests verifies.

## 4. Waves

Each item is one small conventional commit series on `main`, strict
TypeScript, tests next to the code, provenance recorded for moved modules,
and no claim of parity without evidence.

### Wave 1 (this session)

### Wave 2 (landed 2026-10-08, see the commit log for details)

- `chart` model and parsers (plan step 5): the neutral `ChartSpace` model,
  `parseChartSpace` over the shared DOM, xlsx as first client (identical output
  on 364 real chart parts) and Word chart loading are in. Remaining: a neutral
  writer, the pptx alias, chartex (`agnostic-core-plan.md`, step 5).
- pptx document properties through `opc/properties`: done. The shared writers
  now patch parts in place (unchanged bytes survive for every format); the
  pptx updater is a thin adapter. Output differs from the old pptx writer only
  in formatting and is closer to the source file.
- Shared chrome: the Word ruler drives `office-ui-ruler` (markers, margins,
  zoom and extent were added to the shared element); Visio follows the shared
  `--office-*` theme through one alias block; the xlsx bridge is the shared
  `shadcnBridge`. Title bar and status bar: done. docx, xlsx and pptx draw
  `office-ui-title-bar`, and all four products `office-ui-status-bar` (Visio
  has no title-bar row; its Quick Access Toolbar sits in the ribbon head).
  `pptx-ui-title-bar` and `pptx-ui-status-bar` are subclasses that keep their
  published events and hooks; their look is `:host` tokens only (the shared
  elements gained `--office-title-bar-name-foreground`,
  `--office-title-bar-result-selected` and
  `--office-status-bar-separator-opacity` for it), and the pptx style modules
  are gone. Backstage and find bar remain.
- Diagram layout engine out of pptx (plan step 2): model types, the engine,
  the `dgm:choose` walkers (ported to the engine's ordered-XML tree, pptx
  converts its raw slots at one adapter), the constraint solver and the
  interpreter model moved to `diagram`, strict; the hierarchy family and the
  remaining interpreters stay in pptx (step 2 status in
  `agnostic-core-plan.md`).
- Visio reads its theme and DrawingML colours through `drawingml`; the
  `Diagram*` aliases are gone outside `diagram`.
- Gradient raster gaps (bug 3): the coincident-stop case is fixed from native
  measurements (Excel paints a one-step ramp, not a hard edge); the sixteen
  translucent three-stop cases stay pinned with measured differences in the
  test and in `xlsx-parity-status.md`.
- `src/ui/tsconfig.pptx.json` extends the base; `src/core/pptx/ui` compiles
  strict; the Playwright Chromium helper is shared by docx and xlsx.
- Every viewer typecheck is green (the `e2e/docx`, `e2e/xlsx`, teams Svelte
  demo and pptx CLI breaks were fixed).

### Wave 3 (landed 2026-10-08)

- SmartArt (plan step 2): the `dgm:choose` walkers now read the engine's
  ordered-XML tree (pptx converts its raw slots once at one adapter), and the
  constraint solver and interpreter model moved to `diagram`, strict, with
  byte-identical results on 353 layout definitions. Remaining: the hierarchy
  family (51 modules), the remaining interpreters, editing, and a neutral
  paragraph model for text projection.
- Neutral chart writer: `writeChartSpace` round-trips Office-written parts
  byte for byte where the model is complete; new Excel charts go through it.
  Remaining: trendlines, error bars, walls and floors, data tables, display
  units in the model; `chart-patch.ts`; the pptx writers.
- Chart parity harness: every chart part in every committed deck (81 parts)
  is parsed by both the pptx and the neutral parser and compared; all 74
  classic parts agree. It found and fixed three bugs: the neutral parser
  missed the line group's `c:smooth`; pptx ignored `c:style` written under
  `mc:Fallback`; pptx treated a bare data-label switch as off. The pptx chart
  style palette now follows Office's gallery (style 2 starts at accent 1).
- Shared chrome: the pptx title and status bars are themed through host tokens
  only (their style modules are gone). `office-ui-comments-pane` carries Word's
  pane and Excel's Show Comments list. Remaining: backstage, find bar, the pptx
  comments panels (one per binding), Excel threaded-comment editing.
- Collaboration: `ooxml-core/xlsx/collab` binds an Excel edit session to a Yjs
  workbook (cells, formulas, styles, rows, columns, merges, sheets, names,
  selections; conflict rules documented in `collab-area.md`). Remaining: UI
  wiring in `<xlsx-editor>`, and the docx adapter moving into its area.
- Excel sparklines are read, laid out and drawn (line, column, win/loss) from a
  fixture generated by real Excel. Remaining: authoring, exact pixels.
- Hygiene: the slow Word Yjs test exposed a real cost (ribbon control lookups
  re-scanned the DOM on every transaction) that is now cached; Visio theming is
  documented; four redundant `.oxfmtrc.json` copies are gone.

### Wave 4 (landed 2026-10-08)

Browser verification ran for the first time since Wave 1, one agent per
product, with `--workers=2` on Chromium (Playwright 1.63):

- PowerPoint: 148 tests across the autosave-recovery, web-control-contract,
  title-bar, status-bar, ui-primitives, every chart and every SmartArt spec
  pass on all five demos (the WebGL-gated 3D specs ran on SwiftShader); new
  specs cover the root display options and the chart style palette. It caught
  two real cross-binding bugs: Vue, Angular and Svelte never bound the chart
  axis-label fonts the shared view model emits, and chart style palettes were
  built from the fixed Office accents rather than the deck theme (Angular
  ignored the style entirely). Both are fixed in the shared layer with a test
  per binding; the chart now carries the theme accents for rendering only.
- Excel: every `chart-*` spec (387 tests) plus `framework-matrix`,
  `clipboard-parity`, `formatting`, `editing` pass in all six frameworks; new
  specs cover sparklines, the Show Comments list, every binding's own handle
  and two-window collaboration.
- Word: 452 tests across the comment, review, field, locale, parity and
  ribbon specs pass in all six frameworks; new specs cover the shared comments
  pane, the ruler drag and the binding handles. It caught a real Wave 2
  regression: Word never registered `office-ui-ruler` (the unit test had
  masked it by registering everything), now fixed with a test that would have
  failed. Two flaky specs were made deterministic.
- Visio: 68 ungated tests pass (the `VISIO_NATIVE_*` captures stay skipped);
  new specs cover the shared theme tokens and the `aria-label` on every host.
  It caught a real flaky-share bug (the host never published a drawing when a
  load-time zoom swallowed the load event), now fixed with a regression test.
- Teams: the whole suite (30 tests) passes in all six frameworks; new specs
  cover the host class, the `open-file` event and the PowerPoint reading view.
- The demos for Excel and Word now drive each binding's real handle (before,
  no browser test reached the bindings' handles at all).

Implementation:

- pptx charts off `fast-xml-parser` (plan step 6): classic chart parts are read
  by the neutral parser and adapted to `PptxChartData`, proven deeply equal to
  the old parser on every committed chart before the old parser was deleted;
  the neutral model gained walls, floors, data tables and display units. It
  exposed two pptx writers that saved undeclared `c15`/`c16` prefixes (fixed),
  and decks this library saved that way are repaired on load with a reported
  issue. Styles, ChartEx and the chart writers still use the object tree.
- SmartArt layout (plan step 2): the hierarchy arranger, every other
  interpreter up to `interpretSmartArtLayout` and their closure (253 files)
  moved to `diagram/hierarchy` and `diagram/layout`, strict, byte-identical on
  the corpus; node text projection (needs a neutral paragraph model) and the
  editing reflow (needs a neutral drawing shape) remain in pptx.
- One chart painter: the Excel SVG painter moved to `chart/render` over a
  neutral `ChartSummary`; `renderChartSpaceSvg` draws any `ChartSpace`. Word
  now draws bar, column, line, area, pie, doughnut, scatter and radar charts
  in the editor and in Print Layout (read-only; bubble, stock, surface and
  chartex show a labelled frame). The pptx DOM renderer still has its own.
- Excel collaboration is wired: `collaboration` on `<xlsx-editor>` and every
  binding, File > Share, remote selections painted from a DOM-free layout,
  presence in the title bar, undo routed through the Yjs undo manager while
  bound. The browser spec found a join-time race (a guest could seed a blank
  workbook over the host's); the fix makes the shared transport announce
  presence before answering a sync request and makes a joiner wait for an
  earlier writer's workbook.

### Wave 4 follow-ups (landed 2026-10-08)

- Excel opened a real 66,000-formula workbook (one 6.5 MB sheet) in about
  1.6 s of core time because every worksheet was parsed into a full DOM, and
  the first edit recalculated every formula. Worksheet cell data now goes
  through a lightweight reader in `xml/lite.ts` (falling back to the DOM for
  anything it does not handle), the first edit trusts stored values and
  computes only what it reaches, and the formula tokenizer no longer slices
  the source per match: core load 1.6 s to 0.33 s, time to first painted
  grid in the browser roughly halved. `src/core/scripts/xlsx/profile-load.ts`
  measures each stage. Still slow: the first edit (about 0.5 s, building the
  dependency graph) and structural edits (full recalculation).
- Excel chrome now matches Excel 365: the editing-mode selector, Comments and
  Share sit at the right end of the ribbon tab row (a new `actions` slot on
  the shared ribbon tabs), the search box is centred in the title bar, the
  title bar's collaboration slot holds presence only, and the status bar
  reads Ready, selection statistics (a new `summary` slot on the shared
  status bar), view buttons, zoom. A reported double "Ready" bar could not be
  reproduced in any framework, width or theme, or on the deployed demo; a
  unit test and a browser spec now assert one status bar. Word and
  PowerPoint still place Comments and Share elsewhere (follow-up).

### Excel engine follow-ups (landed 2026-10-08)

- The formula dependency graph is now prepared in idle time after the first
  paint (`EditSession.prepareCalculation`, `src/ui/src/xlsx/calc-preparation.ts`,
  slices under 8 ms, paused while the user types or scrolls), and parsing is
  cached by formula shape (digits blanked; 129 shapes cover this workbook's
  66,434 formulas): the first edit after preparation costs about 12 ms instead
  of about 400 ms, first paint unchanged.
- Row and column inserts and deletes, and sheet renames, shift the graph in
  place and recalculate only what the edit can change, each checked against a
  full recalculation from scratch: about 3 s to about 0.5 s on that workbook,
  rename to 0.13 s. F9 now recalculates only dirty and volatile cells as Excel
  does (`calculateNow({ full: true })` is Ctrl+Alt+F9). Still rebuilding:
  undo of a row or column edit, edits on sheets with spills, cut array
  formulas, cell shifts, sort, move, sheet add/delete/move.
- Selection statistics use the first numeric cell's number format.
- The formula number lexeme is unambiguous (a CodeQL polynomial-regex alert
  raised by the tokenizer change); the three lint errors another commit left
  in the office app shell are fixed.

### Chrome consistency (landed 2026-10-08)

- One shared `office-ui-ribbon-actions` element (mode selector, Comments,
  accent Share, in Office's order) sits in the ribbon tab row's `actions`
  slot for Excel and Word; PowerPoint's five bindings place a
  `pptx-ui-ribbon-actions` subclass at the right end of their own tab row
  (Record, Comments, Share). Word gained a Share entry point (a cancelable
  `file-command`, the host supplies the transport). The pptx tab row itself
  is still a per-binding look-alike of the shared ribbon tabs; replacing it
  with `office-ui-ribbon` is the remaining unification step.

### Wave 5 (open items, status 2026-10-22)

Landed since the plan was written: the shared backstage, find bar and print preview
(`src/ui/src/chrome`), editable Word Print Layout, Excel pivot authoring and Page Layout, Excel and
Visio collaboration. Still open:

- pptx binding factory; per-binding contract parity tests for all products;
  the pptx comments panels on the shared pane; the pptx tab row on
  `office-ui-ribbon`.
- pptx chart styles, ChartEx and the chart writers onto the neutral model;
  the pptx DOM chart renderer onto `chart/render`.
- Neutral paragraph model in `drawingml`, then SmartArt text projection and
  editing out of pptx; the engine's ordered XML onto the shared `xml` DOM.
- The docx Yjs mapping lives in `src/core/docx/ui/yjs-collaboration.ts`; whether it should become
  a `DocumentAdapter` over `collab` like the Excel mapping is undecided.
- Product parity is tracked in the per-product pages, not here: Word shapes and page-story
  editing, Excel pivot filters and sheet-part collaboration, Visio connector routing and glue.
