# Visio parity review, 2026-10-07

Reviewed baseline: `f6e9b730a` (ooxml-core 0.23.0, ooxml-ui 0.30.1). The Findings section was
re-checked against the tree on 2026-10-22; the dated round sections below describe the state at
their dates.
The original working directory was detached at `7364222cc`, so this work uses
an isolated checkout of the current remote main. The current architecture places
VSDX semantics in `src/core/visio`, browser rendering and controls in
`src/ui/src/visio`, and six bindings, demos and browser tests in the viewer areas.
The capability ledger remains `viewers/visio/docs/parity.md`.

## Findings

The viewer is a substantial beta, with local VSDX loading, master/style inheritance,
cached geometry, rich-run text rendering, layers, search, shared ribbon controls,
page navigation, zoom, source-backed history and bounded editing/save operations.
These are implemented subsets. The Home tab's clipboard, font, paragraph, Shape Styles,
Change Shape, Arrange and connector commands are enabled (`src/ui/src/visio/ribbon-home.ts`,
ledger in `viewers/visio/docs/parity.md`). Insert > Chart (`viewer-insert-chart.ts`,
`core/visio/edit-chart-object.ts`) and the data-link and data-source dialogs
(`viewer-data-links.ts`, `viewer-data-sources.ts`) are implemented; the commands that stay
disabled (for example the 3-D effects in Shape Styles) carry their reason in the tooltip, and the
ledger lists which ones. Six bindings share one controller and renderer.

The broad blockers are formula/master recalculation, live connector routing and
glue, accurate text measurement, complete line/fill/theme/foreign-object support,
general editing and native round-trip validation. Containers and swimlanes and
legacy formats (`.vsd` is preview only) still have substantial gaps; stencils (Open Stencil in the
Shapes pane, `stencil-catalog.ts`), printing (`print-snapshot.ts`) and collaboration
(`src/core/visio/collab`, per-shape merge with cursors) exist as bounded implementations. There is
no defensible overall parity percentage or full native visual-equivalence claim.
Historical verification counts in the ledger are not fresh results from this review.

## First implemented increment

Open orthogonal connector rounding previously rejected sections when the saved
radius did not fit. It also allowed full endpoint radii where native Visio reserves
half the segment. Ordered radius allocation now matches nine measured Visio 16.0
cases. The shared core correction reaches all six viewers through their existing
renderer, without adapter changes. Endpoint coordinates, transforms and package
payloads are untouched; extra emitted arcs retain the geometry-command budget.

The Apache POI 60973 regression now covers eighteen cached corners across seven
connectors. Shape 825 agrees with native exported radii. Shape 149 is recalculated
by Visio when opened and remains a live-routing gap. See
[connector evidence](visio-connector-rounding.md) for provenance and reproduction.

## Round three: stencils, obstacle routing, formula functions (2026-10-15)

- Stencil files: `readVisioStencil` reads `.vssx`, `.vstx` and `.vsdx` masters (connection
  points and Shape Data ride on the master shapes); `drop-stencil-master` carries the stencil bytes
  and copies the master, with its style sheets, into the drawing's masters part before saving an
  instance that references it (reused by UniqueID). The Shapes pane opens stencils from More
  Shapes > Open Stencil and collects My Shapes for the session. Open limits: legacy `.vss` and macro
  packages are refused, masters that own pictures are refused, stencil line and connector masters
  are listed disabled, nothing persists between sessions, and master icons are redrawn from shapes
  rather than read from the `<Icon>` element.
- Routing: a placeable shape moved, resized or turned onto a right-angle connector's saved path
  makes the core route that connector around it (`edit-connector-follow.ts`), for drawn connectors
  and Dynamic connector instances. Not done: reroute preview during the drag for connectors that are
  not glued to the dragged shape, straightening when the obstacle leaves, non-Dynamic connector
  masters, and any comparison against fresh Visio captures (the existing recordings cover the
  glued-end cases only).
- Recalculation: ROUND, INT, TRUNC, POW, EXP, LN, LOG10, ASIN, ACOS, ATAN and the TRUE/FALSE
  constants are evaluated, so formulas that use them no longer refuse a resize or move. Still
  refused: SUM, DEG, RAD, string and document-property functions, INDIRECT and the other
  reference-building functions, `ThePage!` / `TheDoc!` references, and dependencies on inherited
  or grouped cells. ROUND's two-argument form is read as decimal places, which is not yet checked
  against Visio.

## Round four: straight stencil connectors, string, angle and point functions (2026-10-15)

- Connectors: Design > Connectors (Right-Angle, Straight, Curved) and the Connector tool's style
  choice already rewrote `ShapeRouteStyle` / `ConLineRouteExt` and the Geometry rows of drawn and
  Dynamic connectors. New: straight line masters from the Connectors, Annotations and Arrows
  stencils (the Angled connector and the other one-dimensional line and arrow masters that are not
  the Dynamic connector) follow glued shapes, and their own ends can be dragged. The instance is
  recalculated from its master's formulas and saved as Visio saves it (`F="Inh"` caches, flip flag
  dropped when it returns to the master's); `scripts/record-visio-stencil-line.ps1` recorded the
  native files, and the saved cells match them cell for cell (cell order apart), and Visio 16
  opens them. A master whose formulas do not put the path's ends on the connector's ends is
  refused, and so is restyling such a line to right-angle or curved (only the Dynamic connector
  has the routing cells). Still refused: line masters that are groups, hold pictures or chain
  another master; masters whose text-angle or other drawn cells use functions the evaluator
  lacks; the elbow, tree and flowchart-direction routing styles. The Design > Connectors menu
  still offers all three styles for a stencil line, because the model cannot tell it from a
  Dynamic connector; choosing another style reports the refusal.

- Recalculation: LEN, FIND, STRSAME, LOOKUP, INDEX, MID, LEFT, RIGHT, UPPER, LOWER, TRIM,
  SUBSTITUTE, REPLACE, CHAR and the `&` join evaluate on text written in the formula itself;
  SUM, DEG, RAD, ANG360, PNTX/PNTY of `PNT(x,y)`, ISERROR, IFERROR and BOUND's excluded-range type
  evaluate as numbers. Edge behaviour (FIND of a missing string is #VALUE!, LOOKUP is zero-based and
  returns -1, INDEX out of range is empty, DEG only labels its argument as an angle) was recorded
  from Visio 16 with `scripts/record-visio-formula-functions.ps1`.
- Still refused: a cell's own text (`TheText`, `Prop.x` strings), so LEN(Prop.Name) refuses;
  string results at the top of a formula; STRSAMEEX, ANGLETOLOC, LOCTOPAR, LOCTOLOC, ANGLETOPAR,
  PATHLENGTH and the other path functions, FORMAT and the date and time functions, point results
  and arithmetic on points, INDIRECT and the other reference-building functions. MAGNITUDE is not a
  ShapeSheet function (Visio reports a formula error for it).

## Implementation order toward parity

| Order | Work                                                                                                             | Acceptance evidence                                                                                                   |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Expand the native comparison harness to fonts, paths, styles, transforms and themes                              | Versioned native VSDX and reference exports; per-feature geometry/pixel differences, with settings and fonts recorded |
| 2     | Finish cached viewing fidelity: arrowhead codes/sizing, gradients/patterns, text tabs/fields and foreign objects | Native-authored feature matrix plus genuine document regressions; explicit fallback diagnostics                       |
| 3     | Implement scoped ShapeSheet/master dependencies and connector glue/routing                                       | Resize/move native masters and connected shapes; compare dependent geometry after native reopen                       |
| 4     | Add general source-backed editing: style/rich text, selection transforms, pages, shapes and clipboard            | Atomic edits, undo/redo, untouched-part preservation and native save/reopen checks                                    |
| 5     | Add container/swimlane semantics, stencil/template workflows and export/print behavior                           | Representative native workflows and browser coverage across the six bindings                                          |

Treat native render parity, interaction parity and save parity as separate gates.
A matching synthetic render cannot establish package preservation, and a successful
library round-trip cannot establish that Visio reopens the result unchanged.
Each increment should update the capability ledger with its tested subset and
remaining limits. Full 1:1 parity remains a multi-stage target.

## Verification for this increment

- Visio core: 70 test files passed, 1,408 tests passed and 29 optional tests skipped.
  Native rounding and the hash-pinned 60489/60973 theme corpus were enabled;
  the other external corpus environments were not configured.
- Shared Visio UI: 40 test files passed, 433 tests passed and one optional skip.
  JSDOM reported its expected missing-canvas notices. Browser tests were not run.
- Visio documentation: 48 tests passed, including site build and capability ledger.
- Both core TypeScript projects passed. Formatting and diff whitespace checks passed.
- The nine-case native Visio 16.0 generator passed. Re-parsing its native VSDX
  agrees with exported circular radii, sweeps and tangent endpoints (within
  0.0002 inches for SVG coordinate rounding). The real-corpus regression passed.
- Visio ESM/CJS bundles and tsc declarations built. The existing `build:visio`
  shortcut fails in tsup's declaration worker because TypeScript 7 exposes no
  JavaScript `sys` compiler API. Verification disabled tsup's declaration step
  and used the repository's tsc declaration project separately. No dependency
  or build configuration was changed for that unrelated tooling issue.

Changes are local and unreleased. These checks cover this increment; they do not
establish complete native visual, editing or save parity.

## Native open-arrow increment

Open arrow styles 1 and 3 now use native measured proportions and line-width-dependent
sizes; diagonal tick style 9 is newly rendered. The geometry sizing rule lives in
core and shared UI supplies SVG markers for all six bindings. Seven sizes at three
line widths for each style match 63 native Visio 16.0 exports at unit drawing scale.
The compact numerical reference records native glyph coordinates and scale, without
shipping native documents or generated SVG markup. Reproduce it with
`scripts/record-visio-open-arrows.ps1` on Windows with Visio installed.

Native open markers use round joins/caps and have no endpoint setback. Regression
checks compare local glyph coordinates after the native y-down to model y-up
conversion, and cover endpoint anchoring, opacity, orientation and inert SVG export.
These are geometry checks, not a browser pixel equivalence claim. Filled arrow styles
2, 4 and 5 retain their explicit approximate-sizing warning. Non-unit drawing scales,
filled-marker setback, other codes, print behavior and full native pixel comparisons
remain unverified. Full Visio parity is still incomplete.

The subsequent increment adds native curved open style 7, moving open-glyph geometry
into core alongside sizing. The reference matrix now covers 84 native exports. Its
Bézier controls, local coordinate conversion and stroke paint are checked independently
of marker construction. The generator also saves a native-authored 84-shape VSDX for
optional parse-to-render coverage (`VISIO_NATIVE_OPEN_ARROWS_DIR`). Styles 6 and 8 and
filled-end setback remain unsupported or approximate; full parity remains unfinished.

Verification after the curved-arrow increment: 1,573 core tests passed (34 optional
skips), 521 shared UI tests passed (one optional skip), and core/UI typechecking passed.
The shared UI run included native-authored VSDX parsing and rendering for all 84 cases.
Native pixel rendering in browsers, filled sizing and non-unit scales were not tested.

## Native filled-arrow increment

Filled triangle and curved-base styles 2, 4, 5 and 6 now use measured native glyphs,
sizing and endpoint setbacks on single straight, round-capped connectors at unit
drawing scale, where the setbacks fit. Style 6 is newly supported in this subset.
Native fills have no outline. The original model path is preserved; the shared UI
renders a shortened stroke and positions the marker tip at the original endpoint.

The core helper reproduces the asymmetric begin setback and its small stem extension:
the begin setback is the end setback minus the larger of 0.005 inches and one percent
of the end setback. This rule matches all 84 two-ended reference exports. Another
84 one-ended exports verify the glyph coordinates and end setback. Reference stem
coordinates are checked to the precision of Visio's SVG export. Regenerate with
`scripts/record-visio-filled-arrows.ps1` (add `-BothEnds` for the second matrix), and
set `VISIO_NATIVE_FILLED_ARROWS_DIR` / `VISIO_NATIVE_FILLED_BOTH_DIR` to the output
folders to verify saved native VSDX parsing and rendering. Only numerical evidence
is committed; generated VSDX/SVG files stay local.

Overlapping arrows can make Visio reverse the stem and change setbacks. Curved,
closed and multi-segment paths, overlapping setbacks and non-round caps retain the
approximate fallback for styles 2, 4 and 5. Style 6 reports those unsupported cases
without rendering a guessed marker. Non-unit drawing scales, browser pixel parity,
other arrow codes, routing, text layout, editing and save fidelity remain incomplete.

Verification for this increment: 1,750 core tests passed (34 optional skips), 534
shared Visio UI tests passed, 48 documentation tests passed, and both core typecheck
projects plus shared UI typechecking passed. The UI run enabled the native open,
one-ended filled and two-ended filled VSDX matrices, plus the hash-pinned real
code-5 corpus. Browser pixels and general native save/reopen parity were not tested.

## Native short end-arrow increment

One-ended straight filled arrows now match Visio when the arrow is longer than the
line: the saved glyph keeps its size, its setback becomes zero, and the stem remains
at the original endpoints. At equal length, Visio emits a duplicate origin and a
small stem extension with a correspondingly reduced marker setback. Longer lines
retain the previously verified trim. These cases are resolved in core; the UI uses
the returned stem and marker anchors without changing the document model.

The new matrix covers 168 exports (four styles, three sizes, two stroke weights and
seven length ratios), including the exact boundary. Reproduce with
`scripts/record-visio-short-arrows.ps1`; `VISIO_NATIVE_SHORT_ARROWS_DIR` enables the
saved native VSDX parse/render check. Native SVG stem coordinates are compared at
export precision. Zero-length paths, two-ended overlaps, curved paths, drawing-scale
handling, browser pixels and full parity remain unverified or unsupported.

Verification: 1,919 Visio core tests passed (34 optional skips), 703 shared UI tests
passed, and both core typecheck projects plus shared UI typechecking passed. The UI
run included all native arrow matrices and the hash-pinned code-5 document corpus.

## Native drawing/page-scale increment

The parser now converts cached drawing geometry to physical page inches using
PageScale/DrawingScale, including page bounds, paths, transforms and text frames.
Stroke weights, font sizes, text margins and paragraph indents keep their physical
sizes. Pointer-driven rectangle insertion converts page inches back to drawing
inches; the source-backed edit API continues to accept drawing inches.

Six native-authored pages verify page and rectangle dimensions, filled-arrow stems,
rounded geometry, font size, margins and indents at different scale ratios. Reproduce
with `scripts/record-visio-page-scales.ps1`; `VISIO_NATIVE_PAGE_SCALES_DIR` enables
saved native VSDX parse/render checks against the committed numerical reference.
Synthetic save/reparse and controller undo/redo checks verify scaled insertion and
resize while preserving source scale metadata and untouched parts.

Native save/reopen editing acceptance remains incomplete: resizing the native
reference document fails with EDIT_UNKNOWN_DEPENDENCY because its ShapeSheet
contains dynamic dependencies that the edit index cannot prove safe. This failure
was retained as a remaining editing gap, without dropping formulas to bypass it.
Grouped and foreign placements have normalization code, but broader native reference
coverage and browser pixel comparisons remain outstanding. Full parity is unfinished.

Verification: 1,942 Visio core tests passed (30 optional skips), 705 shared Visio UI
tests passed, 48 documentation tests passed, and both core typecheck projects plus
shared UI typechecking passed. Native arrow and page-scale matrices and the pinned
real-document arrow/theme corpus were enabled. Browser pixel equivalence and native
editing save/reopen acceptance remain unproven.

## Native font-lookup edit increment

The scaled reference document's dependency rejection was traced to FONT("Arial").
Microsoft documents FONT as a font-name lookup, with identifiers that depend on the
system/document, rather than an implicit ShapeSheet cell lookup:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/visio/font-function.
The dependency analyzer now admits its explicit AST references while retaining
unsupported evaluation. An affected FONT formula still rejects recalculation, and
an INDIRECT argument still rejects dependency proof. Independent font formulas and
cached identifiers are preserved during geometry editing.

A native acceptance probe resized page ID 6, shape ID 2 to 8 by 4 drawing inches and
moved its pin to (6, 4). Visio 16 reopened the edited VSDX with those exact cached
values, FONT("Arial"), DrawingScale 2 and PageScale 1, exported the rectangle and
saved reopened-scales.vsdx. Core parsing reports physical size 4 by 2 inches and
local translation (1, 1). This closes the specific font-lookup rejection above;
general native editing/save fidelity and full parity remain unfinished.

Verification after the font fix: 1,946 Visio core tests passed (30 optional skips),
including the native scale edit test, and strict core typechecking passed. After
rebasing onto concurrent main changes, the relaxed PowerPoint typecheck fails on
unresolved ooxml-core/pptx self-imports in newly moved editor modules; no Visio error
was reported. The earlier scale increment's UI and documentation checks remain valid.

## Source-backed page insertion

The shared page bar now inserts a blank foreground page after the selected page,
through the existing worker, controller and package history. Core owns stable page
IDs, unique names, PageSheet copying, OPC relationships and content-type additions.
Existing page parts and other untouched package payloads remain byte-preserved.
The shared extended-property writer updates the existing Pages title/count category
while preserving other categories and unknown extensions. Undo clamps selection when
a removed page was the last page; redo restores the inserted page.

Native Visio 16 reopened an inserted page in the genuine scale corpus at index 5
of eight pages, with ID 99, literal name "Inserted & Page", zero shapes, cached size
8.5 by 11 drawing inches, DrawingScale 2 and PageScale 1. It saved the drawing again.
The expected physical dimensions are 4.25 by 5.5 inches. Core also accepts a subsequent
rectangle insertion on the new page. The acceptance script is
`scripts/verify-visio-page-insertion.ps1`. Set `VISIO_NATIVE_PAGE_SCALES_DIR` and
`VISIO_NATIVE_PAGE_INSERT_OUTPUT_DIR`, run `visio/edit-pages.test.ts`, then pass its
`core-inserted-page.vsdx` to that script with an output directory. Native binaries
and generated renderings remain local.

Insertion currently requires a separate transaction from shape edits. Page-number
and page-count-dependent formula caches are reported as unrecalculated. Renaming,
reordering, deleting pages, broader PageSheet/background semantics, and complete
native save/render fidelity remain unfinished. Full Visio parity is not established.

Verification: 1,958 Visio core tests passed (30 optional skips), 706 shared Visio UI
tests passed, and all six browser insertion/history/download/reopen cases passed.
The broader shared UI suite also passed 1,908 tests (six optional skips); its combined
script then found no PowerPoint tests matching the Visio filter. Documentation checks
passed all 48 tests. Strict core typechecking and ESM/CJS core plus ESM UI builds passed.
UI typechecking still reports the pre-existing Teams/PowerPoint declaration-resolution
errors from concurrent main changes, with no Visio errors. Native Visio acceptance
was repeated after the extended-property update; reparsing its resaved drawing confirms
page order, dimensions and the refreshed Pages property vectors.

## Source-backed page reordering

The All pages menu now opens Reorder Pages on the shared Office dialog, with a page
list, Move Up/Down, OK and Cancel. The draft becomes one atomic core transaction.
Core changes page metadata and the extended-property title order while keeping page
IDs, existing page payloads and relationships unchanged. Moving to the existing index
returns the original bytes with no changed parts. Insertion and ordering can share a
page transaction; shape edits still require a separate transaction.

The controller preserves the selected page by ID, emits its updated index to the
framework bindings, and checks shape selection against that relocated page. Undo and
redo preserve page identity. Draft cancellation leaves the source unchanged; replacing
the source closes stale drafts, and outdated errors cannot alter a new dialog draft.

A native Visio 16 reference moved page ID 6 to native index 1 via Page.Index. Its order
was 6, 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. The core-produced drawing reopened in Visio with that exact
order, seven pages and Page-4 first, then saved successfully. Native outputs remain
local beside the scale corpus. Reproduce core output by setting
VISIO_NATIVE_PAGE_SCALES_DIR and VISIO_NATIVE_PAGE_ORDER_OUTPUT, then running
visio/edit-page-order.test.ts. The comparison uses the genuine scale-corpus document,
not a synthetic package as native acceptance evidence.

The six-binding browser workflow now also moves the inserted page, checks selected
page identity through undo/redo, and downloads/reopens the ordered drawing. Page-number
and page-count formula caches remain explicitly unrecalculated. Page rename/delete,
broader background semantics and complete native render/save fidelity remain open.

Verification: 1,967 Visio core tests passed (30 optional skips), 708 shared Visio UI
tests passed, and six browser workflows passed across every binding. All 48 documentation
checks passed. Strict core typechecking and core ESM/CJS plus shared UI ESM builds passed.
UI typechecking continues to fail only on the existing Teams/PowerPoint declaration
resolution errors. Native Visio reopen/save was verified independently of browser tests.

## Numeric page-dependent cache recalculation (2026-10-07)

Page insertion and reordering now refresh local numeric PAGENUMBER() and PAGECOUNT()
caches, including their supported static dependency closure and PageSheet cells.
Formula and unit attributes stay intact. Unchanged page contexts preserve their
payloads. Foreground numbering ignores background pages; background page numbers
are zero. PAGECOUNT counts foreground pages only, as specified by Microsoft's
[PAGENUMBER reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/visio/pagenumber-function)
and [PAGECOUNT reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/visio/pagecount-function).

The numeric evaluator requires explicit document context for these functions.
Affected cycles, unsupported functions, inherited or grouped dependencies and
master/style page-dependent formulas fail the transaction before saved bytes are
returned. Page changes without affected numeric page formulas retain their previous
preservation behavior. This is a bounded local numeric subset: string page functions,
inherited master materialization, general fields and foreground rendering of a
background page's fields remain open.

Native Visio 16.0 was exercised with two foreground pages and one background page.
An actual Page.Index reorder left the moved page's PAGENUMBER user-cell cache stale,
even after save/reopen and reassignment of the identical formula. Toggling to a literal
and back forced native recalculation. The core output matches that freshly evaluated
reference by stable page ID, including transitive User.Number+User.Count caches.
The core-produced output then opened and saved in Visio with every expected value.
An inserted foreground page was also accepted and saved: all existing foreground
and background shapes reported a count of three with correct page numbers and sums.
The change implements the documented numeric result, rather than reproducing this
native stale-cache behavior.

Reproduce with scripts/record-visio-page-formulas.ps1, set
VISIO_NATIVE_PAGE_FORMULAS_DIR to its output directory, run
visio/edit-page-formulas.test.ts, then run the script again with -CoreOutputPath
pointing to core-reordered.vsdx. Native binaries remain local; the compact metrics
are committed in `visio/__fixtures__/page-formulas-native.json`. To verify insertion
too, pass -CoreInsertedOutputPath pointing to core-inserted.vsdx.

Verification: 1,977 Visio core tests passed with the native numeric/arrow/scale
references enabled (30 optional skips); strict core typechecking and Visio ESM/CJS
builds passed. All 702 shared Visio UI tests passed (six optional native skips),
all six browser insertion/reordering/history/save workflows passed, and all 48
documentation checks passed.

## Page renaming with references (2026-10-07)

The shared All pages menu now opens a Rename Page modal. Its draft captures a stable
page ID and document generation. Cancel leaves bytes unchanged, invalid names remain
editable, source replacement closes stale drafts, and undo/redo preserve page and
shape selection. The saved copy retains the renamed page after reopening in each
of the six framework demos.

Core `rename-page` changes the local name. When the universal name is not custom,
the first rename changes both names and marks them custom. Subsequent local renames
preserve a custom universal name, matching native Visio 16.0. The distinction is
documented in Microsoft's [Page.Name](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/visio.page.name)
and [Page.NameU](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/visio.page.nameu)
references. Stable IDs, OPC targets and background assignments are preserved;
the Pages category in app properties is refreshed.

Static `Pages[NameU]!` references are rewritten outside formula string literals.
Literal hyperlink subaddresses and direct local/cross-page `PAGENAME()` and
`PAGENAME(750)` caches are updated with their local/universal names. Core follows
relationships rather than assuming conventional page part paths, and preserves
unrelated opaque XML. Complex page-name expressions, affected string-valued
dependent formulas, dynamic dependencies and inherited page-name caches remain
outside the admitted subset and reject the transaction atomically. General text
field display recalculation and arbitrary page-name formula graphs remain open.

Native acceptance covered a shape's page-name cache, a cross-page PageWidth formula
and a hyperlink into the renamed page. Both the first rename and a subsequent local
rename opened and saved in Microsoft Visio with every expected name, cache,
reference and link target. Reproduce with `scripts/record-visio-page-rename.ps1`,
set `VISIO_NATIVE_PAGE_RENAME_DIR`, run `visio/edit-page-rename.test.ts`, then pass
`-CoreOutputPath` and `-CoreSecondOutputPath` to the oracle script. Compact results
are in `visio/__fixtures__/page-rename-native.json`; native VSDX outputs stay local.

Verification: 1,991 Visio core tests passed with native references enabled (30
optional skips), 705 shared Visio UI tests passed (six optional skips), and all six
browser page insertion/reorder/rename/history/save workflows passed. Strict core
typechecking, core Visio ESM/CJS and shared UI ESM builds passed. Full Visio parity
remains unproven; page deletion, inherited/string formula closure and the broader
rendering/interaction corpus remain required.
The broad UI typecheck still reports the existing Teams/PowerPoint declaration
resolution errors; it reports no Visio errors.

## Page deletion and reuse review (2026-10-07)

The shared All pages menu now includes Delete Page with an Office dialog, Cancel,
source-generation checks and pending-operation guards. The controller drops shape
selection from a removed page, keeps surviving page identity when possible, and
uses a surviving page when the current page is removed. Undo/redo restore the
source-backed document. The six-binding workflow deletes a page, restores and
reapplies the deletion, then downloads and reopens the remaining drawing.

Core deletion implements native `Page.Delete(0)`: surviving page names stay intact,
static formulas pointing to the removed page become their cached constants, and
hyperlink destination text remains intact. Deleting an assigned background clears
its BackPage assignments. Page XML, its owned relationship part, incoming page
relationships and content-type overrides are removed. Unrelated opaque XML and
shared assets are preserved. Drawing windows pointing at a deleted page are moved
to a surviving foreground page. Local numeric page-count/index caches use the
existing bounded dependency recalculator.

Deleting the last foreground page leaves a new blank foreground page. The observed
native default in this corpus is 8.5 by 11 inches with unit drawing/page scale;
core uses those defaults. Native replacement IDs are allocated by Visio, whereas
core chooses a fresh package-owned ID. Template/locale-specific default settings,
Visio's historical default-name allocator and the optional native renumber-pages
mode remain open. Dynamic references, error caches and unsupported explicit XML
relationship uses fail atomically rather than leave dangling relationships.

Native Visio 16.0 independently accepted and saved core-produced referenced-page,
assigned-background and last-page deletion outputs. Metrics include surviving IDs,
names, background assignments, dimensions, scales, shape counts and frozen formula
and link values. Reproduce with `scripts/record-visio-page-delete.ps1`, set
`VISIO_NATIVE_PAGE_DELETE_DIR`, run `visio/edit-page-delete.test.ts`, then rerun the
script with `-VerifyCore`. The compact record is
`visio/__fixtures__/page-delete-native.json`; native files remain local.

The reuse review replaced duplicate relationship-path and relationship-ID code
with existing OPC helpers. Rename and deletion now share one relationship-driven
inventory of editable page/master/document parts and one formula-string scanner.
The existing XML model, page-properties writer, dependency graph, package writer,
controller/history and shared Office dialog/menu/button controls remain the common
implementations. AGENTS.md now explicitly requires checking for reusable logic
and reviewing helpers/imports for duplication before committing.

Relative `.js` imports are intentional ESM specifiers: TypeScript resolves them
against the `.ts` source. The repository's ESNext/Bundler configuration also allows
extensionless imports, but the existing `.js` convention supports JavaScript
runtime paths. A direct Node ESM import of the built `ooxml-core/visio` entry passed.

Verification: 2,001 Visio core tests passed with native references enabled (30
optional skips), 708 shared Visio UI tests passed (six optional skips), and all six
browser page/history/save workflows passed. Strict core declarations/typechecking,
core Visio ESM/CJS and shared UI ESM builds passed. A later native verification
rerun stalled during reopening and was terminated; the record above is from the
completed earlier run. Full parity remains unproven.

## Extensionless imports (2026-10-07)

Following the explicit repository preference, Visio TypeScript sources now use
extensionless relative imports, including core, shared UI, framework bindings,
demos and tests. This supersedes the `.js` source convention described above.
The existing ESNext/Bundler configurations support these paths. Runtime `.mjs`
script imports, package subpaths, JSON imports and built asset/worker URLs retain
their required extensions. The published runtime remains bundled ESM/CJS;
JavaScript source output is not emitted as an unbundled runtime module tree.

The clean NodeNext consumer check exposed unresolved exports when declarations
retained extensionless relative paths. One shared declaration normalizer now runs
in core, UI and Visio package builds; it changes generated declaration paths to
ESM extensions only when matching emitted declarations exist. Source imports stay
extensionless. Comments, string literals, explicit asset extensions and package
subpaths are preserved. Its regression compiles a strict NodeNext consumer and
checks that public types do not silently become `any`. The Svelte package builder
also rewrites its extensionless common source import to the built runtime URL.

Verification: strict core typechecking/declaration generation, direct Node ESM/CJS
imports and a strict NodeNext consumer of the local core package passed. All 2,001
core tests and 708 shared UI tests passed (30 and six optional skips respectively).
Binding typechecks, Svelte checks, 79 client tests, five SSR tests, viewer
TypeScript, all seven package builds and the six browser page/history/save
workflows passed. All 129 repository script tests passed. The broad UI declaration
build retains its existing Teams/PowerPoint resolution errors; Visio declarations
were emitted and the binding checks passed against them.

All seven tarballs also passed a clean registry-only consumer install, ESM
imports, NodeNext declarations, Svelte consumer compilation and production parser
and edit-worker checks after the shared declaration step.
