# MCP ownership and release order

The standalone packages live in this repository, one per viewer, and only register the tools:

| Directory                     | Package          | CLI         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| `viewers/docx/mcp`            | docx-viewer-mcp  | docx-tools  |
| `viewers/xlsx/mcp`            | xlsx-viewer-mcp  | xlsx-tools  |
| `viewers/visio/mcp`           | visio-viewer-mcp | visio-tools |
| `viewers/pptx/packages/tools` | pptx-viewer-mcp  | pptx-tools  |
| `mcp`                         | ooxml-mcp        | ooxml-tools |

## Tools are headless functions in core

Word, Excel and Visio tools are defined once, in `ooxml-core/automation`
(`src/core/automation/tools/`): `docxTools`, `xlsxTools` and `visioTools`, also grouped as
`automationTools` and looked up with `findAutomationTool(name)`. Each definition carries its
name, description, kind (`read`, `create` or `edit`), accepted extensions, its parameters (a Zod
raw shape as `input`, and JSON Schema from `jsonSchema()`) and `run`, a function over the file's
bytes that validates its parameters itself. Reads never return bytes; edits return the new bytes
with a report (warnings, results). No parameter is a file path: where the bytes come from is the
caller's business. So the MCP servers, the suite's assistant and a host's own backend call the
same code and get the same validation and bounds. A host that has an editor open on screen can
run the same tools against it with `createLiveToolHost` (see `docs/embedding.md`, "Letting your
assistant drive the open editor").

`ooxml-core/automation/node` adds the local filesystem: `runAutomationFileTool(files, tool,
params)` runs a tool on a file confined to a root (reads never write, creates never overwrite,
edits replace the source atomically unless `outputPath` is given), and
`registerAutomationTools(server, tools, { rootDir })` registers a list on an MCP SDK server with
`filePath` (and `outputPath` for edits), the read-only and destructive hints, JSON text results
and tool errors. Core types that server structurally and never imports the MCP SDK at runtime.

The standalone packages are therefore thin: each `registerTools` is one call to
`registerAutomationTools` with its format's list, plus its stdio CLI. A new tool, a schema change
or a bound belongs in core, with its tests in `src/core/automation/`, never in a package.

The OOXML package composes the standalone packages' `registerTools` exports.
It supports all four formats by default, or an explicit subset. A selected package
that is missing or incompatible fails startup with an installation message.
Importing a package never starts a stdio transport; each CLI does so explicitly.

## Coverage

- Word: `docx_inspect` (blocks, stable paragraph ids, runs), `docx_list_form_fields`,
  `docx_create`, `docx_set_run_text` (ordinary runs only), `docx_suggest_run_text` (the same
  edit as tracked changes) and `docx_fill_form_fields`.
- Excel, reads first and every read bounded: `xlsx_inspect` (sheets and their sizes; start here),
  `xlsx_read_range` (at most 10,000 cells), `xlsx_read_filled_cells` (one sheet or all, at most
  10,000 cells, default 2,000, with per-sheet totals and omitted counts), `xlsx_find` (at most
  1,000 matches plus the total) and `xlsx_read_table` (at most 10,000 cells); then
  `xlsx_create` and `xlsx_set_cells` (at most 10,000 inputs, recalculated by the core).
  `xlsx_propose_edits` (read-only: the diff of a list of edits and a sealed proposal) and
  `xlsx_apply_proposal` (applies an approved proposal to the unchanged file), see
  `docs/agent-edit-review.md`.
- Visio: `visio_inspect` (binary image payloads omitted) and `visio_edit`, an atomic batch of
  the supported text and conservative geometry edits.

Unsupported edits reject and core warnings and diagnostics are returned. These APIs do not imply
Word, Excel or Visio parity or lossless export.

XLSX inspection reports, per sheet, its state (`visible`, `hidden`, `veryHidden`), its used
range (the cells it stores, formatting included) with row and column counts, and its tables
(name, range, header and totals rows); it also reports the active sheet and the defined names
(hidden names are left out; a sheet-scoped name carries `sheetIndex`). Tables per sheet and
names are capped at 500 each, and `tablesOmitted` and `definedNamesOmitted` count the rest.
A range read returns, for each cell, its value and formula, the text as the grid displays it
(the cell's number format applied by the core formatter), the number format code (absent for
General) and, for date and time formats, the value in ISO 8601 without a time zone (`2024-04-03`,
`10:30:00` or `2024-04-03T10:30:00`; durations such as `[h]:mm` have none).
`xlsx_find` (`findXlsxCells`) searches the way Excel's Find does (formulas as typed or values as displayed,
match case, whole cell, `*` `?` `~` wildcards, optionally one sheet or range) and returns at most
1,000 matches, each with its sheet, address and the same cell view, plus the total count.
`xlsx_read_table` (`readXlsxTable`) reads a table by name (ignoring case, as Excel does): its sheet, range, header
and totals rows, column names and cells (at most 10,000, as a range read).

PowerPoint uses the same definitions: `pptxTools` in `ooxml-core/pptx/automation`
(`src/core/pptx/automation/catalogue/`), registered by `pptx-viewer-mcp` with the same
`registerAutomationTools` call. It keeps its established 73 tool names (`get_slide`, not
`pptx_get_slide`). Each wraps a core tool function (`(ctx, params) => ToolResult`): the deck is
loaded from the bytes, the function runs, and an edit that marked the deck dirty returns the
saved bytes; one that changed nothing (a list action) writes nothing. Reads accept `.pptx` and
`.ppt`; edits only `.pptx`, because they save PresentationML. `convert_to_markdown` takes a
relative `outputDir` only (it prefixes media links; nothing is written). The `pptxTools` list is
kept out of `ooxml-core/automation` so that entry never pulls in the PowerPoint bundle. The
PowerPoint assistant in `ooxml-ui` runs the same core tool functions and schemas on the open,
in-memory deck rather than on bytes.

Every MCP package declares `ooxml-core` (and the combined server its viewer packages) as
`workspace:*`, so the workspace always tests them against the core in this checkout. Publishing
rewrites each to `^<version on disk>` in the packed manifest, and a package waits for a sibling
released in the same run to reach npm, so a tool change in core and the packages that register it
land in one commit and one release. The standalone packages ship JavaScript source and
declarations (the PowerPoint one is built), so no other step is needed.
Tests are excluded from npm tarballs. Install a standalone package's dependencies
and run `npm test` inside its `mcp/` directory to exercise protocol contracts.
Core round-trip, edit and filesystem tests live in `src/core/automation/`.
