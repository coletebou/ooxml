# Office UI package

`ooxml-ui` (`src/ui`) is the second published package of this repository. It holds the web
components every Office product needs, and the product editors' DOM code under `ooxml-ui/<product>`.
The plan this page used to hold (a first publish, wave-by-wave tag migration and viewer adoption
steps written when the viewers lived in other repositories) is complete and was removed; this page
keeps the decisions that still apply. For how the elements are built and the subclass contract, read
`src/ui/README.md`.

## Decisions

- **Layout.** The repository root is a private workspace root. `src/core` is the published
  `ooxml-core` and `src/ui` the published `ooxml-ui`; the UI declares `"ooxml-core": "*"` and
  resolves the core through the workspace link. The release flow rewrites workspace ranges to caret
  ranges when it publishes (`docs/releasing.md`).
- **Direction.** UI may import core types and pure helpers; core never imports the UI (nothing in
  `src/core/` references `src/ui`).
- **Style.** Every shared element is a Lit class on `OfficeElement` (`src/ui/src/base.ts`): a
  `<name>.ts` with a `render()` template next to a real `<name>.css` imported `?raw`, using bare
  `var(--office-x)` tokens, grouped in a folder per kind. The product editors (PowerPoint, Word,
  Excel, Visio, Teams) are imperative custom elements that keep their own `?raw` CSS. Importing a
  module never touches `HTMLElement` at load time where SSR matters. Typed events include
  `office-command`, `office-dialog-close`, `office-presence-select`, `office-status-activate` and
  `office-smartart-render`, plus native `input` and `change` for value controls.
- **Product rule.** Viewers list `ooxml-ui` as a normal `dependency` of every published editor
  package, so users never install it by hand.
- **Honesty.** `office-ui-smartart` shows the cached drawing and reports approximated geometry,
  fills and flattened 3D in its render event. It makes no layout-parity claim.
- **pptx tags.** The public `pptx-ui-*` tags remain as thin subclasses of the `office-ui-*`
  elements (`src/ui/src/pptx/web-components/office-aliases.ts`), which translate their old events
  and attributes, so existing hosts keep working.

## Token map

The PowerPoint editor maps its `--pptx-*` variables to the `--office-*` contract on its host
element, so its theming API did not change. The other products follow the same contract with their
own prefixed overrides as fallbacks.
