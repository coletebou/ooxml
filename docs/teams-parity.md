# OpenTeams parity review and implementation sequence

Reviewed 7 October 2026 (the repeat and allowlist rows re-checked against the code on 2026-10-22) against `src/core/teams`, `src/ui/src/teams`,
`viewers/teams`, the reference server, and the Teams browser tests.

The target is Microsoft Teams user-workflow parity. This is an early workspace,
not an implementation of the Microsoft Teams service or its app platform.
No feature is considered equivalent solely because a control is present.

## Current coverage

| Area                            | Evidence in the implementation                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Remaining work                                                                                                                                                                     |

## First implemented slice: content previews

Attachment Open actions now retain the workspace and display a preview pane.
The cancelable `teams-open-file` event and per-kind `openers` still take precedence.
Closing returns to the current workspace view. Switching channel or workspace
clears the preview; superseded fetches are aborted and late responses ignored.

- Word and Excel use the existing native editor elements in read-only mode.
- Visio uses the existing viewer. Its local viewer interactions are not shared
  edits and are not written back to file storage.
- Markdown supports ATX headings, bullets, quotes, fenced code, bold, italic,
  inline code, flat task lists, top-level pipe tables and file-relative web links. Raw HTML remains text.
  This is a subset, not CommonMark or GFM parity.
- `.txt`, `.csv` and `.json` have literal text previews.
- HTML attachments and the Files view's **Preview website** action use sandboxed
  frames. Scripts and forms are allowed; same-origin, popups and top navigation
  are not. Sites may refuse framing or require functionality the sandbox blocks.
  An external-open link remains available; iframe load is not proof of successful
  site rendering. There is no TeamsJS or Microsoft app manifest compatibility.
- PowerPoint uses the shared DOM renderer in reading mode with navigation,
  slide text, notes, embedded fonts and native audio/video controls.
  A host embedding page via `embeds.pptx` can override it.

Attachment byte reads omit ambient credentials and referrers. Text is capped at
2 MiB and Office bytes at 32 MiB, including streamed responses without a size
header. Cross-origin files need appropriate CORS. Signed URLs are preserved;
an expired link must be reopened from the attachment to request a fresh link.
Local-mode name-only attachments still have no bytes to preview.

Linked presentation media and supported online-video embeds follow browser and
provider request policies. An administrative allowlist of media embed origins is not implemented (this is separate from the reference server's CORS allowlist).

### Integration contract

All six component bindings accept `embeds` through `TeamsProps`. Angular exposes
an input; Vue declares and watches the prop; Solid snapshots it; React, Svelte
and vanilla forward the common props contract.

```ts
const embeds = {
	pptx: ({ url }: { url: string | undefined }) =>
		`https://viewer.example.com/embed?source=${encodeURIComponent(url ?? '')}`,
};
```

The host must provide a real viewer page that understands `source` and supports
the sandbox and CORS. A normal demo URL does not automatically load an attachment.
Do not configure the raw `.pptx` URL as an embed page. The callback is trusted
host configuration, never peer-provided code. Only web URLs are accepted.

The custom element also exposes `previewContent({ attachment, url })` for
host-provided content. It is a local view action and does not publish a tab or
message to other users. For a website use `kind: 'other', mime: 'text/html'`.

## Second implemented slice: shared tabs and XLSX workflows

Channel members can pin an uploaded file from Files or add a named website tab.
Tab definitions use stable IDs in the workspace CRDT and persist with its snapshot;
selection remains local. Creator-side rename/remove checks are advisory, just like
message ownership, and do not provide authenticated server authorization. Peer data
is validated before rendering. Name-only attachments cannot become file tabs.

Excel opens in viewing mode and offers **Edit workbook** and **Download workbook
copy**, including without channel storage. With server storage or a host upload
adapter configured, it also offers **Save copy to channel**. Channel saving serializes
the native workbook, uploads under a unique storage name, and posts a new attachment
in the channel captured when the file opened. It does not overwrite the original,
switch the tab to the saved copy, or coedit with other users. Macro workbooks keep
their `.xlsm` extension; macro execution is not supported.

Failed uploads leave the workbook dirty and available for retry. Edits made during
upload remain dirty after the older snapshot is shared. Navigation asks before
discarding edits and is blocked while saving. If another client removes an open
tab, its local pane remains available until closed. Unrelated presence updates
do not reload open content. These guards do not protect against a host forcibly
replacing the component, identity or workspace configuration.

Evidence: core tab merge/snapshot and upload tests; UI lifecycle tests; browser
tests with two same-browser clients adding, renaming and removing a website tab;
and an actual XLSX fixture edited, saved, parsed and reopened, including upload
failure/retry and editing during upload. The eight workflow specs now run against
each of vanilla, React, Vue, Angular, Svelte and Solid with
`bun run test:browser:bindings` in `viewers/teams`. Each run forces fresh Vite
dependency optimization to cover first-open behavior, including the lazy
PowerPoint engine and Word metafile converter.
The suite uses local mode and test upload adapters; it is not evidence of
authenticated remote coediting or renderer fidelity across all files.

Microsoft Teams supports editing and coediting files from channel tabs and uses
SharePoint-backed channel folders. Save copies are an incremental OpenTeams
workflow, not evidence of matching those collaboration or storage semantics.

## Third implemented slice: creating, uploading and finding files

The channel and workspace Files views now offer **Upload files**, **New Excel
workbook** and file search by name, author, channel and type. New files target
the channel named beside the controls. Workbook creation delegates to the
SpreadsheetML engine, stores a real blank XLSX, posts it in the captured channel
and opens it locally. Existing same-name files keep their own storage URLs.

Uploads and new workbooks require configured storage. Failures retain the selected
files for retry, with the original destination named in the error. Uploaded batches
are posted only when every upload succeeds; a failed batch can leave unreferenced
storage objects and currently has no server cleanup contract. The size limit is
32 MiB per file, with at most 20 files in a batch. This implementation reports a
completed-file progress and cancellation, not byte-level progress. File search covers loaded
attachment metadata, not indexed document contents or folders.

Message attachments now also keep their original channel and reply target while
uploads are pending, without clearing a newer reply started in another channel.
Browser evidence covers workbook creation, same-name upload preservation, upload
failure/retry, file search and opening uploaded Markdown bytes.

## Fourth implemented slice: static PowerPoint previews

This initial SVG baseline is superseded by the DOM reading view in the
twenty-fifth slice below. Presentation playback remains outstanding.

PPTX attachments now open without host embed configuration. The pane delegates
parsing and SVG generation to the existing core PowerPoint engine, displays the
SVG as an isolated image, and offers previous/next navigation, speaker notes,
top-level slide text and parser compatibility warnings. Replacing or closing
a preview disposes the parser and revokes slide image URLs. External images
are disabled and expanded package bytes are limited to 128 MiB.

Visual inspection of a real ten-slide deck exposed unwrapped paragraphs in
the SVG exporter. Core export now wraps horizontal text, retains run formatting
and supports optional host font measurement. The Teams pane supplies canvas
metrics for the fonts the browser actually renders; headless callers use the
existing core font tables and fallback metrics. Explicit no-wrap text is honored.

This is a static baseline, not PowerPoint renderer parity. Font substitution,
paragraph geometry, vertical text, autofit and complex layouts can differ.
Animations, transitions, media playback and editing are unavailable. The pane
states these limits and exposes text so layout differences do not hide all
readable content. Browser acceptance checks actual deck bytes, visible slide
images, navigation, text and cleanup; it does not compare Microsoft reference
screenshots or prove layout equivalence.

## Fifth implemented slice: local workbook copies

The latest XLSX increment adds local copy downloads. Downloads serialize through
the existing workbook engine and do not upload or post a new attachment. The
explicit copy-download action reports that the download started and keeps its local dirty state;
browser delivery does not prove that the user retained the file. Invalid pending
cell edits block both downloads and channel saves instead of exporting the old
cell value. Switching viewing/editing mode also commits or rejects pending edits.
Browser acceptance covers a real stop-validation rule, downloading and parsing
edited bytes, source preservation, absence of a shared attachment, and navigation
confirmation. This remains a copy workflow, with the engine's existing format
support and preservation limitations.

## Sixth implemented slice: file transfer control

The Files controls now cancel uploads and workbook creation, retain their captured
destination for retry, and show completed-file progress. Core copy-save actions
also accept cancellation and progress callbacks. The workbook save-copy toolbar
offers cancellation during serialization or upload, retains local edits, and allows
retry. It does not yet display byte or file-count progress. Closing the Files panel or replacing its client
aborts its active operation. Cancellation stops waiting even when a host storage
adapter ignores its optional abort signal, and guards prevent late attachment
publication. Already written objects can remain in storage because there is no
cleanup contract. Browser tests exercise pending cancellation, late completion,
retry, and progress between files across all six bindings. Workbook browser acceptance
also checks canceled save copies, ignored late storage writes, retained dirty edits,
and a successful retry without publishing the canceled copy.

## Seventh implemented slice: structured Markdown previews

Markdown previews now render top-level pipe tables with column headers, alignment,
escaped pipes, missing-cell padding and excess-cell truncation. Flat unordered task
items show disabled checked/unchecked controls: a preview does not mutate the source.
Relative links resolve against the attachment URL, while unsafe schemes, credentials
and protocol-relative links remain literal text. Signed source queries are not copied
to sibling resources. Tables have keyboard-focusable horizontal scrolling and use
the same safe inline text bindings as the rest of the preview. No HTML or automatic
image loading is introduced. Nested containers, full inline precedence, reference
links and CommonMark/GFM conformance remain unsupported. The syntax reference is
the [GFM specification](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-);
this subset does not establish Microsoft Teams rendering equivalence.
Tables are limited to 128 columns and 16,384 generated cells (including headers).
Wider tables and rows beyond that limit remain readable as ordinary source text.

## Eighth implemented slice: channel thread panes

Channel conversations now show root posts with live reply counts and open a focused
thread pane. Nested reply chains resolve to their original post; deleted parents
remain visible, and missing-parent/cyclic input retains a deterministic visible root.
Only non-deleted replies contribute to counts. Thread selection stays local to each
client and resets on a channel change. Replies, reactions, edits, deletion and file
cards reuse existing core actions. Search results open the corresponding thread.
The pane replaces the main conversation at narrow widths. Browser acceptance uses
two real local clients and checks live replies, nested replies, deleted parents,
search navigation and responsive layout. Thread notifications,
cross-pane draft retention, authenticated membership and server enforcement remain
unsupported. The reference workflow is Microsoft's
[thread pane and followed threads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/teams/teams-channels/follow-threads-in-microsoft-teams).

## Ninth implemented slice: personal followed threads

The thread pane supports follow/unfollow. A personal Followed threads view lists
channel roots, live non-deleted reply counts and latest activity, and opens the
correct channel and thread. Preferences persist locally per user and workspace;
they do not enter the shared channel document. Restored preferences tolerate
missing messages until hydration, late parents, duplicate aliases and unavailable
storage. Archived channels are excluded. Unit coverage checks restoration and user
isolation; browser acceptance checks follow, live counts, reload, navigation and
unfollow across six bindings. This is a device-local list: cross-device preference
sync, automatic following and thread notifications remain unsupported.

## Tenth implemented slice: unread followed threads

Followed threads carry separate personal read markers. Opening a thread marks
its current messages read; rendering its pane in a visible browser document also
marks newly arrived replies read. Viewing channel roots alone does not mark the
collapsed threads read. The list exposes unread counts, mark-read/unread actions
and an unread-only filter. New non-deleted messages from other authors contribute
to counts; edits and reactions do not. Explicit unread marks persist locally.
Tests cover foreign/self/deleted messages, no-op read updates, restoration, filtering
and reopening. This is not a shared read receipt or notification delivery system;
cross-device state, viewport-level reading detection, activity notifications and
automatic following on mentions remain outstanding. These controls follow Microsoft's
[followed-thread inbox workflow](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/teams/teams-channels/follow-threads-in-microsoft-teams).

## Eleventh implemented slice: automatic following preferences

Successful new posts (including channel file posts) and replies through the client
actions automatically follow their thread root. Personal settings independently
disable following started threads or replied-to threads and persist per user and
workspace. Defaults enable both. Edits and rejected empty sends do not create
follows, and existing follow choices are not changed retrospectively when a setting
changes. Low-level writes through `workspace.chat` remain host-controlled and do
not infer personal follow intent. Unit tests check both settings, restoration,
author action results and defensive preference copies; browser acceptance checks
post following, opting out, reload and independently enabling reply following.
Automatic following on mentions and following all content in a channel remain
unsupported, alongside notifications and cross-device preference sync.

## Twelfth implemented slice: personal message drafts

Posts, thread replies and edits retain separate drafts through channel, thread and
view navigation. A Drafts view lists unsent messages and resumes their original
compose context. Drafts stay outside Yjs and persist per user and workspace in
local storage. Text is restored after reload; file bytes stay in memory during a
session. After reload, restored attachment names require reattaching or explicit
discard before sending. The UI does not silently send a draft without those files.
Successful sends clear their captured draft without clearing newer text typed
during an upload; rejected edits retain the draft. Local storage is bounded to
512 KiB of serialized text/metadata, 500 restored contexts and twenty attachments per
draft; blocked storage or larger snapshots preserve only session state. Cross-device
draft sync, durable attachment bytes, unavailable-message recovery and shared read
receipts remain outstanding. Unit tests cover context isolation, defensive copies,
restoration, blocked storage and send races. Browser acceptance covers post/thread
navigation, retained attachment bytes, central resume, reload, missing-attachment
guard and sending. Microsoft's current
[Drafts quick view](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/teams/platform/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams)
is the workflow reference; this local implementation does not establish full parity.

## Thirteenth implemented slice: reliable chat attachment transfers

Message attachments use configured storage, retain their display names and receive
fresh storage names on every attempt. A post or thread reply is published only
after every file has a valid URL. Missing storage, invalid files and partial upload
failures retain the complete draft instead of publishing filename-only cards.
Channel transfer status shows completed file counts and supports cancellation,
including adapters that ignore abort signals. Failures and cancellations recover
the original text and attachment bytes in Drafts; newer text typed during the send
is preserved as a separate draft. Resuming and sending uses the captured channel
and thread context. Unit and browser coverage exercises partial failure, retry,
cancellation, late adapter completion, preserved bytes and concurrent new text.
Progress counts completed files rather than transferred bytes. Uploaded storage
objects are not automatically removed after failure or cancellation because the
storage contract has no deletion operation. Durable attachment recovery, shared
storage permissions, folders and version/save-back contracts remain outstanding.

## Fourteenth implemented slice: Shared and Files presentation

Channel files use the current Shared tab label. The Files view presents a New menu,
Upload command and search field above a semantic table of filenames, sharing
dates, authors and channel locations. Clicking a filename opens the existing
preview; pinning retains the existing channel-tab workflow. The native file picker
is hidden behind Upload, and the prominent website URL form has been removed from
Files. Websites remain available through Add tab and host content previews.
Unavailable file bytes disable opening instead of pretending a filename is a file.
Desktop and narrow-screen browser acceptance covers upload, retry, workbook
creation, search, filename opening and table overflow. This is an incremental UI
alignment with Microsoft's [Shared file workflow](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/teams/files/collaborate-on-files-in-microsoft-teams),
not pixel-perfect parity. Folder navigation, file selection/bulk actions, views,
sorting and permission-aware sharing menus still need implementation.

## Fifteenth implemented slice: Settings navigation and personal appearance

The Settings shell now separates General, Appearance and accessibility,
Notifications and activity, Files and links, and Connection. Light/dark/system
choices apply within OpenTeams and persist per user/workspace on this device;
they do not change the host document theme. Followed-thread preferences share the
existing core personal settings. Keyboard category navigation and mobile layouts
are covered in browser acceptance. Connection settings preserve validation and
explicit Apply/Cancel behavior; cancel discards unapplied edits. Replacing the
client flushes pending local document snapshots so reconnect does not discard
recent posts or tabs. Files and links initially explains the built-in preview;
the next slice adds the browser default. Desktop defaults, density, notification delivery, account/privacy controls
and device selection still require implementation. Microsoft's
[settings categories](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/teams/customize-your-teams-chat-interface-with-chat-density-settings)
and [notification preferences](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/teams/notifications-settings/manage-notifications-in-microsoft-teams)
are references, not evidence of complete visual or feature parity.

## Sixteenth implemented slice: file actions and browser viewer preference

Shared file rows expose a More actions popover with Open in OpenTeams, Open in
browser, Download, Copy link and Pin as tab. Downloads reuse bounded content reads,
request a fresh signed URL and preserve original bytes and filenames. Clipboard
failure retains a selectable link. Menus remain open through unrelated presence
updates, and a changed file/client cancels the pending action. Settings > Files
and links saves the Office open preference per user and workspace on this device.
Browser opens the same native content renderer in a separate tab, not a raw Office
URL. The viewer carries its bounded, validated payload in the fragment, does not
join the collaboration room, and has no opener. Local XLSX editing and download
remain available there; channel save-back and host callback adapters are available
in the main workspace only. Explicit Open in OpenTeams bypasses the personal
browser default; existing host open handlers retain precedence. Browser acceptance
checks actual workbook rendering in both contexts, exact downloaded bytes, link
copying, preference restoration and pin/save-copy behavior. Signed links can expire;
copying does not grant or manage recipient permissions. Desktop defaults, folder
and bulk actions, version/save-back contracts and permission-aware sharing remain
outstanding. Microsoft's [file-open preferences](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/collab-files/open-file-links-directly-in-microsoft-365-desktop-apps-from-teams-and-classic-outlook)
and [Shared file downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/teams/files/download-a-file-from-microsoft-teams)
are the workflow references.

## Seventeenth implemented slice: personal chat density and reload persistence

Appearance and accessibility offers Comfy and Compact with native radio controls.
Compact reduces actual message gaps and bubble padding in channel posts and open
threads. The choice persists per user/workspace on this device without changing
other users' preferences. Browser acceptance measures rendered spacing, keyboard
selection, reload restoration and switching back to Comfy across all six bindings.
The app flushes pending document snapshots on pagehide so immediately reloading
after sending a message preserves it. The core exposes flushStorage for hosts
that own their own lifecycle, without closing the client or interrupting a
back/forward-cache return. This remains browser-local persistence, not a server
durability guarantee. Microsoft's [chat density settings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/teams/customize-your-teams-chat-interface-with-chat-density-settings)
are the reference; chat-list previews and account-synchronized preferences remain
outstanding.

## Eighteenth implemented slice: shell menus and profile status

Settings opens through the top-bar Settings and more menu, using the shared
keyboard-accessible menu primitive. The profile avatar opens a card containing
the supported availability choices and workspace connection status. Status
changes synchronize with peers; Escape restores focus and the card is clamped
inside narrow viewports. Channel-header and thread commands use token-based
button styling. The React demo shows the full workspace by default; its raw-hook
example is available with panel=1. Browser acceptance covers keyboard entry,
dismissal, peer status propagation and desktop/mobile presentation across all
six bindings. Microsoft's [profile status workflow](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/teams/notifications-settings/change-your-status-in-microsoft-teams)
is the reference. Do not disturb, appear offline, status messages/duration,
accounts and automatic meeting/activity-based presence remain outstanding.

## Nineteenth implemented slice: Add a tab app and shared-file selection

Add tab opens a modal app picker instead of an inline URL form. Word, Excel,
PowerPoint, Visio, Markdown, static-site and text apps select files already shared
in the current channel; Website configures a web address. Configuration offers
a tab name, shared-file search, selection, Save, Back and Cancel. Type detection,
URL validation and tab creation reuse the core. Name-only files are excluded.
Removed sources disable Save, and the captured client/channel prevents a dialog
from adding its content to another context. Canceling an unsaved-workbook prompt
leaves the workbook and configuration intact. Browser acceptance renders actual
XLSX, Markdown and static-site content, checks stale selections and cancellation,
and verifies desktop/mobile layouts across all six bindings. Microsoft's
[app and file tab workflow](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/teams/teams-channels/use-a-tab-in-a-channel-or-chat-in-microsoft-teams)
is the reference. App catalogs and permission enforcement, and Office coediting
remain outstanding. Tab conversations are covered by the later slice below.

## Twentieth implemented slice: Settings search and app labels

Settings includes keyword search across implemented categories, titles and
descriptions. Results open the owning panel and focus the setting heading for
keyboard navigation. Clearing search or choosing a category restores its controls;
searching does not discard unsubmitted connection fields. Appearance includes
Show app names, applied immediately and saved per user and workspace. Hidden
app-bar labels retain accessible button names, tooltips, icons and navigation.
Browser acceptance checks search, empty results, focus, connection drafts,
reload and identity/workspace isolation, plus desktop and mobile layouts.
Microsoft's [Settings workflow](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/teams/notifications-settings/change-settings-in-microsoft-teams)
is the reference. Automatic app-bar collapse, regional formats, efficiency mode,
system startup and the wider Teams Settings catalog remain outstanding.

## Twenty-first implemented slice: shared tab conversations

Adding a tab includes the selected-by-default Post to the channel about this tab
option. Its channel post links back to the tab. Show tab conversation opens the
same thread beside the file; replies also appear under that post in Posts.
An unchecked option defers the post until someone starts the conversation.
Core uses one deterministic root per tab, preserving replies when peers start
discussions concurrently, restoring snapshots and retaining deleted roots.
Opening and closing the discussion preserves workbook edits and thread drafts.
Tab rename/remove commands use the keyboard-accessible Tab options menu; compact
header commands and responsive wrapping keep the tab strip reachable on mobile.
Acceptance covers two users discussing an actual edited XLSX, channel replies,
deferred discussion, draft restoration and desktop/mobile layouts. Microsoft's
[tab conversation workflow](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/teams/teams-channels/use-a-tab-in-a-channel-or-chat-in-microsoft-teams)
is the reference. Tab-link deep routing, authenticated permissions, direct/group
chat tabs and Office coediting remain outstanding.

## Twenty-second slice: settings controls and scrolling

Settings uses the shared switch controls for app names and thread preferences,
with Space/Enter keyboard activation, accessible checked state and persisted
preferences. Search and Close stay fixed above an independently scrollable
content panel; category navigation remains reachable at compact desktop and
mobile heights. Acceptance checks both viewport sizes, keyboard switches and
connection draft preservation, alongside the existing settings search and
preference restoration workflows across all six bindings. The category list
still covers only implemented OpenTeams preferences; this does not establish
full Teams settings parity.

## Twenty-third slice: compact channel navigation

Compact windows retain access to channel and call navigation through a modal
navigation drawer. It reuses the desktop sidebar actions, preserves channel
drafts, checks dirty Office content before switching or creating channels,
and closes after successful navigation. Escape, the close button and backdrop
return focus to the opener; resizing to the desktop layout restores the sidebar.
Tab cycles through visible controls, including nested shadow roots, and excludes
collapsed channel lists. Acceptance covers channel creation, call entries,
draft restoration, keyboard focus, resizing, and cancellation with a real edited
XLSX across all six bindings. This restores navigation in OpenTeams' compact
web shell; the native Teams mobile app, combined chat/channel navigation,
favorites and authenticated chat membership remain separate outstanding work.

## Twenty-fourth slice: channel creation dialog

Add channel opens an in-app form for a name and optional description, with
initial focus, validation, cancellation and focus restoration. Standard channels
are the supported type; the form does not imply private or shared membership.
Descriptions retain up to 1,024 sanitized characters, including newlines,
through shared state and snapshots. Channel selection is remembered per user
and workspace and falls back when a channel is unavailable. Cancelling an
unsaved-workbook confirmation preserves both the workbook and channel form.
Acceptance covers desktop/mobile creation, reloads, nested drawer cancellation
and dirty XLSX handling across all six bindings. Microsoft's
[channel creation workflow](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/teams/teams-channels/create-a-standard-private-or-shared-channel-in-microsoft-teams)
and [description limit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoftteams/set-teamchannel)
are references. Multiple teams, private/shared channel membership, authenticated
creation permissions and server-enforced naming uniqueness remain outstanding.

## Twenty-fifth slice: native PowerPoint reading view

PowerPoint files now render through the shared DOM slide renderer and its
existing asset loader. Reading mode exposes accessible slide content and native
media controls without authoring overlays. The preview resolves pictures, table
fills and embedded audio/video, applies deck themes and embedded fonts, and fits
slides to both pane dimensions. Buttons and Arrow/Page keys navigate locally;
notes, slide text and compatibility warnings remain available. Closing or
replacing a preview pauses media, releases media/font URLs and disposes its
archive. Superseded and late loads release their own resources. The archive
expansion budget remains 128 MiB and external image loading remains disabled.

Acceptance exercises actual themed slide content, desktop/compact sizing,
keyboard navigation, real embedded audio playback and teardown across all six
bindings. The shared asset loader retains direct real-deck and media tests.
Animation, transitions, Office editing, meeting slide synchronization, presenter
roles, thumbnails/grid navigation, zoom/pan and shared annotations remain
outstanding. Microsoft's [PowerPoint Live workflow](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/present-from-powerpoint-live-in-microsoft-teams)
is the reference for the remaining meeting integration; a local reading view does
not establish PowerPoint Live parity or exact rendering fidelity.

## Twenty-sixth slice: Settings appearance controls

The Settings surface now gives its implemented categories shared icons, a wider
desktop content area and a persistent category heading. Switching categories
returns the content to its beginning. Theme buttons preview a workspace rather
than a plain color block; the light and dark examples retain their respective
appearance when the active workspace theme changes. Comfy and Compact use visual
message-spacing cards with native radio selection and the existing persisted
chat-density preference. Decorative previews are hidden from assistive technology.

This follows Microsoft's [chat-density Settings reference](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/teams/customize-your-teams-chat-interface-with-chat-density-settings).
The browser checks cover preference persistence, keyboard selection, search,
connection drafts, stable preview colors and a visible category heading while
scrolling on mobile across all six bindings. The initial version used a modal;
the following slice replaces it inside OpenTeams with a full workspace page.
Accounts, privacy, calls,
devices, regional formats, message-preview preferences and other unsupported
settings remain outstanding; this increment does not establish full UI parity.

## Twenty-seventh slice: Settings workspace page

OpenTeams renders Settings beside the app rail and beneath the top bar, following
the full-page structure in Microsoft's Settings reference. The app rail, profile
and global search remain available. The previous channel/chat/file surface stays
mounted but hidden and inert while Settings is open, retaining conversation
drafts, the selected tab and the exact edited workbook instance. Closing with
Escape or Close settings restores focus to Settings and more; choosing an app or
channel navigates through the existing unsaved-content guard. Changing user or
workspace closes Settings. Connection fields still reset from the saved
configuration on reopening, and reconnect remains an explicit action.

`teams-settings` retains its standalone modal behavior by default. The optional
`embedded` attribute enables the modeless, container-sized surface used by
`teams-app`. Desktop/mobile acceptance checks shell geometry, accessible app
navigation, focus return, retained drafts and unsaved XLSX state across the six
framework bindings. The new page structure is one part of UI parity: unsupported
Settings categories and workflow gaps listed above remain outstanding.

## Twenty-eighth slice: Shared file commands and sorting

The Shared/Files toolbar uses the shared menu control for New, including arrow
navigation, Enter activation, Escape dismissal, focus return and a top-layer
popup. Creating a workbook focuses its name field. Upload uses a common icon;
file-type badges use a document silhouette. Name, Shared on and Shared by are
sortable table headings with accessible direction state. Sorting reuses the
DOM-free `sortFiles` core helper, preserves equal-key order and duplicate files,
and applies after the existing multi-word search. Newest shared date remains
the initial order.

The toolbar and table headings stay reachable during long-list scrolling.
Compact layouts hide secondary author/location columns to keep file actions
inside the viewport. Browser acceptance covers keyboard commands, sorting,
duplicate names, creation, upload/retry/cancel, download, copy link and preview
workflows across all six bindings, plus desktop and compact list geometry.

Microsoft's [Shared file workflow](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/teams/files/share-files-in-microsoft-teams)
distinguishes posted content from a SharePoint library. OpenTeams still exposes a
flat attachment list; library folders, Recent/Files/Links views, permission-aware
sharing, versions, file move/copy and storage-backed rename/delete remain gaps.
These command and layout improvements do not establish full Files UI parity.

## Next releasable slices

The PowerPoint DOM renderer, element registry and asset-loading pipeline ship
from `ooxml-ui/pptx/dom`. OpenTeams consumes them in reading mode. Presentation
playback and meeting integration remain necessary before the full PowerPoint
adapter slice is achieved.

1. UI parity: match the current Teams shell, Shared/Files commands, Settings
   navigation, typography, spacing and responsive layouts against reference
   screenshots. Keep implemented preferences functional and expose unsupported
   settings honestly. Visual similarity alone does not establish workflow parity.
2. Shared tab permissions: authenticated membership and server enforcement,
   approved web-app origins and a supported app messaging contract.
3. Full PowerPoint adapter: connect shared animation/transition playback,
   presentation controls and meeting participant synchronization. Add thumbnail
   and grid navigation, zoom/pan, accessible presentation controls and annotations.
4. Files workflow: permission-aware storage IDs, progress/cancel/retry, folders,
   version metadata, and save-back contracts. Add coediting only after identity,
   access control and revision handling are enforceable.
5. Authenticated direct/group chats and activity: participant-scoped rooms,
   mentions, notification preferences, read receipts and message-level search.
6. Meetings and enterprise integration: scheduling and invitations, SFU/lobby
   and roles, captions/recording, then SSO/admin/retention/guest policy.

For each slice: record the Microsoft reference workflow, implement in the owning
layer, add protocol/unit coverage and browser acceptance across the six bindings,
and document observable differences. Measure rendering fidelity with real files
and Microsoft-generated reference output, rather than claiming lossless parity.

## Mobile navigation, pinned messages and richer presence

- **Compact shell (below 56em).** The app rail is a bottom navigation bar (icons and short labels,
  safe-area aware). The channel and call lists are a full-screen view; the conversation, files,
  followed threads and drafts fill the width, and the channel header has a back button to the
  list. The shell resumes in the conversation of the last selected channel. The modal navigation
  drawer was removed. Composer buttons, the add-tab button, Meet now, channel rows and the message
  toolbar reach `var(--office-touch-target, 44px)` under `pointer: coarse`. Phone landscape uses
  thinner chrome. This is a layout comparison, not pixel parity with the native Teams app.
- **Pinned messages.** `pinMessage` / `unpinMessage` write rows to a per-channel Yjs map
  (`teams:pins:<channel>`); the pinned bar shows the newest pin, a count that expands the list, a
  jump action and Unpin. Any member can pin or unpin: the workspace has no role model, so pinning is
  not an enforced permission. Pins of deleted messages are hidden; the list is capped at 50.
- **Presence.** Statuses are Available, Busy, Do not disturb, Be right back, Appear away and Appear
  offline, with reset-after choices (30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, today, this week) and a status
  message that expires on its own. Available turns into Away after a configurable idle time
  (default 5 minutes, `0` never; pure rules in `ooxml-core/teams` `presence`). Peers receive the
  full `status` and a legacy `availability` (Do not disturb as busy, the rest as away) so older
  clients still render presence. Do not disturb silences every notification (see below). Status is
  advisory and unauthenticated like all presence.

## Mentions, activity and notifications

- **@mentions.** Typing `@` in the composer opens a people picker (people who wrote in the
  channel or are online, then `@channel` and `@team`) that filters as you type and is keyboard
  navigable (Up, Down, Enter or Tab, Escape). A mention is stored next to the plain text as a range
  (`mentions: [{ kind, id, name, start, end }]` on the message row), so older clients show the
  message as ordinary text. Ranges are derived from the cleaned text on send and re-validated on
  read. As in Teams, a mention is shown as the person's name without the `@` (highlighted; mentions
  of you and `@channel` / `@team` are emphasised) and the picker inserts the name without the `@`
  too; the `@` stays in the stored text, which keeps the format backward compatible. Because the
  composer is a plain text box, each picked name claims the first matching occurrence in the text
  when the message is stored, so deleting a picked name and typing the same word elsewhere can
  still promote it. Editing a message keeps its mentions. A typed `@Name` that matches a channel
  member counts as a mention too, which differs from Teams. There is no team or
  channel membership model, so `@channel` and `@team` reach the same people and the picker only
  knows people who have written or are online.
- **Activity feed.** Activity is the first item of the app rail (bottom bar on phones) with an
  unread badge. It lists, newest first, mentions of you (including `@channel` / `@team`), replies to
  your messages and to threads you follow, reactions to your messages and pinned-message events,
  with filter pills (All, Unread, Mentions, Replies, Reactions), per-row mark read / unread and Mark
  all as read. Clicking an item opens the channel (or thread) scrolled to the message, which flashes
  once. The feed is a pure projection of the shared document (`deriveActivity` in
  `ooxml-core/teams`); nothing is added to Yjs for it except that reactions now store the time they
  were added (older rows without one are not listed). Read state is personal and local to the
  device (a watermark plus per-item overrides), so it does not follow you to another device; a
  first run starts at "now" so existing history is not a wall of unread items. Pins by you and
  your own actions never appear, and there is no per-channel "notify me" setting.
- **Notifications.** New activity is announced while the app is open: a toast with View and
  Dismiss actions when the tab is visible (toasts stack at the top right below the channel header,
  up to three, never over the compose box; on phones they are full-width banners below the
  header), and a browser `Notification` (click focuses the tab and opens the item)
  when the tab is hidden and the person granted permission. An optional two-note chime plays with
  either. Settings > Notifications and activity chooses All activity, Mentions only or Off, the
  sound, and requests the browser permission. Do not disturb suppresses the toast, the desktop
  notification and the sound (the item still lands in Activity); Be right back, Busy and Appear
  away do not. These are in-page notifications: the tab (or an installed PWA window) must be open,
  there is no service worker push, no email and no mobile push, and nothing is announced for
  history that arrives after a long offline period older than your read watermark. Preferences are
  kept per user on the device.

## Chat and Calendar

- **Chat app.** Chat is the second item of the app rail, right after Activity (and sits in the bottom
  bar on phones). The list is recent first, with presence on each person's avatar, the last
  message as a preview, the time and an unread badge (the rail item carries the total). New chat
  picks one person (opens or creates the 1:1 chat, the same chat whoever starts it) or several
  (a group chat with an optional name). The header has Call (the existing pre-join and mesh call,
  keyed to the chat) and People, which renames a group, adds or removes people and leaves; each
  of those writes a centred notice line into the chat ("Dan joined the chat", "Bob left the chat").
  A 1:1 chat cannot be left or grown. The composer, reactions, @mentions (limited to the chat's
  members), pins, threads, files, drafts and Activity work as in a channel because a chat is a
  `ChatStore` channel row. Chats appear in search and the Files view for their members only.
- **Privacy model.** Each chat has its own Yjs document and sync room
  (`chat-<workspace hash>-<chat id>`), so people who are not members never receive its messages.
  The workspace document holds only a directory (who is in which chat, so every client can find its own
  chats) and a roster of everyone who opened the workspace (so New chat can offer people who are
  offline). The client model never opens, reads or writes a chat the person is not in. The reference
  server admits a socket to a chat room only when its `user` query parameter is in the room's
  `teams:chat-members` map, creates a room from the first socket's `members` list (a 1:1 room must
  list exactly the two people its id was derived from), and closes the sockets of people removed
  from a chat. Honest limits: there are no accounts, so identity is a claim and anyone holding the
  shared token can claim another person's id; the directory (who chats with whom, and group names)
  is visible to every workspace member; attachments are stored under the workspace and are not
  access controlled per chat; local mode (same-browser tabs) cannot enforce anything below the
  client model; a group or meeting chat room is created by whoever connects first; people removed
  from a chat keep what they already synced.
- **Calendar app.** Calendar follows Teams in the rail. The week view switches between work week,
  week and day, has Today and previous / next, lays overlapping meetings side by side and marks
  the current time. The side list shows the next two weeks with a Join button when a meeting is
  near or live. New meeting takes a title, attendees (or a channel), start, end, repeat (none,
  daily, weekly) and details; the organizer can edit or cancel, anyone can Export .ics. A meeting
  with attendees gets a group chat with a meeting card; a channel meeting posts the card in the
  channel and is in everyone's calendar. Join opens the existing pre-join screen for a call keyed
  to the meeting (it can be joined early). On phones the agenda list, the details dialog, the week
  view and the forms are separate full-screen views.
- **Times and zones.** Meetings store UTC instants plus the organizer's IANA zone. A repeat keeps
  the organizer's wall-clock time across daylight saving changes (`ooxml-core/teams` `calendar`,
  `time-zone`; DST gaps move forward and repeated hours take the first); everything is rendered in
  the viewer's zone. A repeat ends never, on a date (the end of that day on the organizer's device)
  or after N occurrences. The organizer can cancel or change one occurrence (Edit or Cancel on a
  repeating meeting asks "This event" or "All events in the series"); exceptions are keyed by the
  occurrence's original start and are voided when the series start or repeat changes. A meeting can
  last at most 24 hours. The `.ics` carries the organizer's TZID on DTSTART and DTEND with a
  VTIMEZONE derived from `Intl` (yearly rules where the zone repeats them, each change written out
  for ten years otherwise), COUNT or UNTIL (UTC), EXDATE for cancelled occurrences and an
  overriding event with RECURRENCE-ID for changed ones; a UTC organizer gets plain UTC times.
  Attendee addresses do not exist, so names go in the description.
- **Reminders.** Five minutes before an occurrence starts the client announces it through the
  Activity notification path: a toast (View opens the meeting), a desktop notification when the tab
  is hidden, and the chime. Off and Do not disturb silence it, and a reminder held back by Do not
  disturb still fires if the status changes before the meeting starts. Each occurrence is announced
  once per device. The tab must be open: there is no push, email or background reminder.
- **Not implemented.** Meeting lobby, roles, recording, captions, backgrounds,
  free/busy and scheduling assistant, RSVP and invitations outside the workspace, an
  .ics import, external calendar sync, per-chat notification settings and chat search filters.
