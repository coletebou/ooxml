Shared, format-neutral web components and styles for the Office products (Word, Excel, PowerPoint,
Visio and Teams), and the product editors themselves as `ooxml-ui/<product>` subpaths. Custom
elements with shadow-root controls and typed events, no framework. The runtime
dependencies are `ooxml-core` (types and a few pure helpers) and `lit`, which every element is built on
(see "How the elements are built").

> **You do not install this package.** It is a regular `dependency` of every published editor
> package (`docx-*-viewer`, `xlsx-*-viewer`, `pptx-*-viewer`, `visio-*-viewer` and
> `openteams-*-viewer`), so installing the editor of your framework pulls it
> in. It is published separately only so that the editors share one copy of the controls. Do not
> add it to your own install instructions or `package.json`; import controls through the editor
> package, which registers them for you. Importing `ooxml-ui` directly is for
> the viewer packages themselves and for people building their own Office-style UI.

## How the elements are built

`office-ui-smartart` accepts `schemeFonts` (`major` and `minor` Latin typefaces)
alongside `schemeColors`. Cached shape font references provide inherited text
color and font; explicit run formatting takes precedence. Color transforms and
alpha reuse the core DrawingML resolver, with unsupported transforms reported in
`unappliedColorTransforms` on the render report.

Every element is a Lit class that reads like a component, in a folder named for what it is:
`<name>.ts` holds the reactive properties and a `render()` template, `<name>.css` the styles (a real
stylesheet imported as `?raw`, tokens only). The folders are `form/` (checkbox, switch, radio, select,
search, zoom), `ribbon/` (button, group, stack, toolbar, tabs, section, toggle), `menu/` (menu button
and item, separator, context menu, command search), `dialog/` (dialog, options dialog, dialog footer),
`notices/` (toasts, read-only banner, paste options), `chrome/` (title bar, status bar and item, tab
strip, task pane, backstage, account, find bar, print preview, ruler), `comments/` (the comments pane), `presence/`,
`smartart/` and `teams/`.

- **`OfficeElement`** (`base.ts`) is the base class, exported for products that build their own
  elements. Bare `var(--office-x)` in a `.css` file gets the token's default when the sheet loads
  (`withTokens`), so an element renders correctly with or without the installed theme.
- **Updates are synchronous.** Setting a property or attribute redraws the shadow DOM before the call
  returns (the contract the earlier hand-built elements had and every test relies on). The team
  elements keep Lit's batched updates (`static syncUpdates = false`).
- **Products subclass these elements** (`ooxml-ui/pptx` registers `pptx-ui-*` aliases that keep their own
  event names and ids), so the base class keeps what those subclasses lean on: the shadow root exists
  when the constructor returns, a connected element renders on first `shadowRoot` read or in a
  microtask even if a subclass skips `super.connectedCallback()`, and a property that a product hook
  reads as an attribute (`icon`, `command`, `launcher`, `placement`) writes the attribute through.
  A constructor must not assign a property a subclass may override with its own accessor (it would
  run the subclass's setter before its fields exist); such state (`state`, `groups`, ...) lives in a
  private field behind a hand-written accessor.
- **Text is exact.** Text-bearing elements are written without whitespace between nodes, because
  consumers compare `textContent`. `oxfmt` is set to `htmlWhitespaceSensitivity: "strict"` for
  `src/ui/src` (not `teams/`) so it never adds whitespace to a template; `glyph.ts` opts out of
  the formatter with `// prettier-ignore` because it reflows `<svg>` regardless.
- **`ribbon-section` and `keytips`** keep imperative DOM on purpose: the section patches light-DOM
  children keyed by id (so focus and a product's tags survive), and keytips attaches a badge layer to
  a scope it does not own.

## Team workspace elements (`ooxml-ui/teams`)

The chat and meeting pieces of the open-source Teams-style workspace (logic in `ooxml-core/teams`,
app in `viewers/teams`, the editor element in `ooxml-ui/teams`): `office-ui-avatar`, `-app-rail`, `-channel-list`, `-chat-list`,
`-chat-composer`, `-prejoin`, `-call-grid` and `-call-controls`. Properties in, bubbling `office-*`
events out, no data fetching; message text is always rendered as text.

`teams-app` opens Settings as a workspace page beside the app rail, retaining
the underlying chat, selected tab and edited workbook. Its `teams-settings`
element also supports standalone modal use; pass `embedded` to render a
modeless page sized to the containing workspace. Escape and Close settings
emit `teams-settings-close`; the host controls the `open` attribute. Personal
preferences apply immediately, while connection changes require Apply and
reconnect.

```ts
import { registerOfficeUi } from 'ooxml-ui';
registerOfficeUi(); // defines every element, idempotent
```

## Install

Applications using a viewer receive this package as a dependency. For a custom
Office UI, install it directly:

```bash
npm install ooxml-ui
```

## Quick start

```js
import { registerOfficeUi } from 'ooxml-ui';

registerOfficeUi();
const button = document.createElement('office-ui-button');
button.setAttribute('label', 'Save');
button.setAttribute('command', 'save');
button.addEventListener('office-command', (event) => console.log(event.detail));
document.body.append(button);
```

## API: entries (ESM only)

The shared `office-ui-gallery` also supports `mode="panel"` for modal pickers.
It displays labelled preview tiles directly, keeps focus when a pick refreshes the
selection, and supports arrow, Home and End keys. Panel mode has no dropdown
trigger or popup; `open` remains false. XLSX uses this mode for chart types while
PowerPoint continues to use the same component for ribbon galleries. A `compact`
panel keeps its tiles at their preview size without visible labels, and its arrow
keys only move focus: PowerPoint's inspector uses it for Text Warp, whose pick
applies at once.

Every entry declares an `import` and a `default` export condition, so CommonJS consumers on Node 20.19+ or 22.12+ load it through `require(esm)`.

`installOfficeUiTheme()` installs one theme stylesheet in the document by default. Pass a
`ShadowRoot` to install scoped mode and control rules inside an embedding app's shadow tree.
`installOfficeUiThemeFor(element)` installs document defaults plus rules in every enclosing shadow
root. Product canvases and `prepareOfficeUiBlock()` use this host-aware installation automatically;
the latter checks again after native framework insertion. Theme attributes inside Angular shadow
views and other shadow containers therefore work alongside inherited custom properties.

Use semantic `--office-*` palette tokens on a shared ancestor to theme all controls. When overriding
a specific derived control token, such as `--office-select-background`, apply it to the actual
control. Product compatibility bridges recompute dependent defaults on their inner chrome so those
controls follow the product palette.

Importing an entry never touches the DOM (SSR-safe). Elements are defined by the `define*` /
`register*` functions, which are idempotent, no-ops without a `window`, and refuse to coexist
with an incompatible build of this package.

## One theme for composed editors

Use the shared `--office-*` CSS tokens on a common ancestor of the canvas and its standalone
controls. `data-office-theme="light"`, `"dark"`, or `"auto"` works on the document root or a
scoped container, so two editors on the same page can use different modes. `auto` follows the
system colour scheme. Nested mode scopes retain inherited typography, spacing and radii.

```html
<section class="office-scope" data-office-theme="dark">
	<!-- Mount the framework's standalone toolbar, canvas and other controls here. -->
</section>
```

```css
.office-scope {
	--office-accent: #0d9488;
	--office-accent-foreground: #ffffff;
	--office-ring: #0f766e;
	--office-font: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
	--office-radius: 6px;
}
```

Change the attribute or CSS tokens through your framework's normal bindings. Theme changes do
not require remounting the editor. The semantic palette includes `--office-background` (fields
and application background), `--office-surface` (toolbar and panel surfaces), `--office-foreground`,
`--office-muted-foreground`, `--office-border`, `--office-selected`, and the accent and focus tokens
above. Document paper, cell fills and slide artwork remain document content.

Library-supplied native building blocks opt into `BUILDING_BLOCKS_CSS` through
`prepareOfficeUiBlock(element, kind, product)`, exported by `ooxml-ui/theme`. It installs the shared
theme in the element's owner document and marks only that control root with `data-office-block`
and `data-office-product`. Hosts' own unmarked controls are unaffected. Shadow-root controls
inherit the same tokens. The installed stylesheet is idempotent and supports forced colours and
touch targets.

Existing product overrides (`--dve-*`, `--xve-*`, `--vv-*`, `--pptx-*`, and legacy theme options)
remain compatibility inputs. An explicit product override wins for that product. For a uniform
composition, put the shared tokens and mode on the common ancestor instead of configuring only
the canvas: a canvas's local theme cannot change the CSS inherited by a sibling toolbar. This UI
theme contract is separate from an Office document's embedded theme.

## Features: elements

`office-ui-menu-button` accepts `submenu` when nested inside another menu.
Its trigger becomes a menu item; hover, click or ArrowRight opens the child
panel beside the parent, with viewport edge placement. ArrowLeft or Escape
returns focus to its trigger; choosing a command closes the whole menu tree.
Arrow navigation stays within the current menu and skips disabled entries.

The local profile behind `office-ui-account` is stored on the device only, under one suite-wide
key (`readOfficeProfile`, `writeOfficeProfile`, `clearOfficeProfile`), so every Office viewer on
an origin shows the same name and avatar colour.

`attachKeyTips(scope)` (from `ooxml-ui/controls`) adds Office KeyTips to any element or shadow
root: press and release Alt to show badges on controls marked `data-keytip="H"`, type a badge to
activate it (controls inside open shadow roots of shared elements, such as ribbon tabs, are included), and use `data-keytip-panel` / `data-keytip-level` for a tab's second level. Escape
steps back; disabled controls are dimmed and never run.

Elements with intent events read their event name and test-id prefix from static class fields (`requestEvent`, `testIdPrefix`), so a product can register a subclass under its own tag that keeps its published contract.

Setting a property never emits an event; only user activation does. Controls honour
`prefers-color-scheme`, `forced-colors: active` (system colours and a visible focus ring) and
coarse pointers (44px targets through `--office-target-size`).

## Ribbon add-in tabs

A host application can add its own ribbon tabs after a product's tabs, as an
Office add-in does (the ACROBAT tab in Visio and Excel). The tab is plain data,
and the same descriptor works in every editor: `ribbonAddIns` is a property of
`<visio-viewer>`, `<xlsx-editor>` and `<docx-editor>` and a prop of each of their
framework bindings, and a prop of the five PowerPoint viewers (which draw their
own ribbon; see `pptx-ui-ribbon-add-in` and `viewers/pptx/docs/guide/customization.md`).

```ts
import type { RibbonAddInTab } from 'ooxml-ui';

const tab: RibbonAddInTab = {
	id: 'reports',
	label: 'Reports',
	groups: [
		{
			label: 'Export',
			commands: [
				{ id: 'export', label: 'Export', icon: 'save', run: () => exportReport() },
				{ id: 'options', label: 'Options', icon: 'settings', size: 'small' },
				{ id: 'send', label: 'Send', items: [{ id: 'send-mail', label: 'By mail' }] },
			],
		},
	],
};
editor.ribbonAddIns = [tab];
editor.addEventListener('office-ribbon-add-in', (event) => {
	const { tab, command } = event.detail; // 'reports', 'export'
});
```

- A command runs its `run` callback and then dispatches the bubbling, composed
  `office-ribbon-add-in` event (`{ tab, command }`) from the editor. It never
  reaches the product's own command router, Tell me or key tips.
- The elements a panel is built from are defined on demand, and a panel whose
  look did not change is kept across assignments, so passing a new array with
  new callbacks on every render is cheap and never closes an open drop-down.
- In the PowerPoint ribbon a drop-down (`items`) is drawn as its items, and the
  phone toolbar does not list host tabs.
- `size: 'small'` commands fill columns of three; `items` makes a drop-down.
  `icon` is a name from the shared icon set; `registerIcon` adds your own.
- Assign a new array to change the tabs; an empty array removes them. A tab
  whose id is empty, repeated or equal to a built-in tab id is skipped, so an
  add-in cannot replace a product tab.
- The descriptor types and the event name are DOM-free and live in
  `ooxml-core/ribbon`; `ooxml-ui` re-exports them.
- Products render the list with `syncRibbonAddIns(ribbon, tabs, options)`
  (`src/ribbon/add-in-tabs.ts`); a new product editor calls it rather than
  building panels itself.

## Design tokens

Every control is token based: no colour, length, radius, font size, shadow, duration or layer
is written literally. `OFFICE_TOKENS` (from `ooxml-ui/theme`) is the single table of
`--office-*` tokens and their defaults; controls read them through `tok(name)`, which expands to
`var(--office-…, <default>)`, so they render correctly with or without the installed theme.
`THEME_CSS` declares every default on `:root`, plus dark-mode and forced-colours values. Override
any token on `:root` or on any container to retheme or resize the suite:

- semantic colours: `--office-foreground`, `-background`, `-surface`, `-selected`, `-border`,
  `-accent`, `-accent-foreground`, `-ring`, `-danger`, `-warning`, `-info`, `-popover`, `-overlay`,
  `-notice-*`, `-paper`;
- scales: `--office-space-*`, `--office-radius-*`, `--office-font-size-*`, `--office-icon-size-*`,
  `--office-control-height-*`, `--office-shadow-*`, `--office-duration-*`, `--office-z-*`;
- component tokens that default to the scales, for example `--office-checkbox-size`,
  `--office-switch-width`, `--office-ribbon-tab-height`, `--office-backstage-nav-width` and
  `--office-dialog-max-width`.

Only the two layout breakpoints (`COMPACT`, `TOUCH`) are literal, because CSS does not allow
custom properties in media queries. A test fails when any control's stylesheet contains a raw
colour or length outside a token, or references an undeclared token.

### Theming a product

A product whose theme variables follow the shadcn names (`--<prefix>foreground`,
`-muted-foreground`, `-card`, `-primary`, `-destructive`, ...) bridges it in one line:
`shadcnBridge(':host', '--dve-')` (from `ooxml-ui/theme`) returns the CSS that feeds every
`--office-*` colour from it. `themeBridge(selector, map)` takes any mapping. Declare the result on
the product's root (or `:host` inside its shadow root) rather than `:root`, so a nested theme or
a dark scheme keeps working.

## Custom Elements Manifest

`custom-elements.json` (the package's `customElements` field, also exported as
`ooxml-ui/custom-elements.json`) lists every element with its attributes, properties and events,
for framework bindings and editor tooling. Properties and attributes are read from the live classes;
events are the names each element fires, taken from its source, so an event dispatched under a name
built at run time would be missing. A test fails while the file is out of date: run
`bun run --cwd src/ui gen:manifest` after changing an element.

`office-ui-smartart` shows the drawing the producing application cached; it never lays out a
diagram itself. Preset outlines it cannot draw are rendered as rectangles, gradient and pattern
fills are approximated, and 3D is flattened. All of that is listed in the `office-smartart-render`
event detail (`approximatedGeometries`, `approximatedFills`, `flattened3d`); nothing is hidden.

## Scope

Only what every Office product needs lives here. Product-specific ribbon content (PowerPoint
slides, transitions, animations; Word styles and review) lives in the product's own subpath (`src/ui/src/<product>/`), not in the shared entries. The
`pptx-ui-*` tags are thin subclasses of the `office-ui-*` elements; `docs/ooxml-ui-plan.md` in the
repository keeps the decisions that still apply (layout, style rules, the tag aliases and the
token map).

## Development

```
bun install
bun run build                              # build core declarations first
bun run --cwd src/ui typecheck
bun run --cwd src/ui test
bun run --cwd src/ui build
bun run --cwd src/ui test:package
```

The Teams PowerPoint preview consumes `src/core/dist/pptx` declarations during
UI typechecking. The core PPTX area still uses relaxed compiler settings;
importing its source into the strict UI project would bypass that boundary.
The UI build first stages PowerPoint declarations in the ignored `.types-pptx`
directory, so the strict Teams build can consume the DOM adapter's declarations
without importing legacy source or overwriting its declaration inputs.
`bun run typecheck` stages the same declarations first, so it needs no prior
build; the vitest config resolves `ooxml-ui/pptx/dom` to source for the same reason.

## Documentation

`ooxml-ui/pptx/dom` exposes the framework-independent PowerPoint DOM renderer.
Use `createDefaultRegistry()` with `renderSlideStage()` to render a parsed
`PptxSlide` into a supplied `Document`. Pass the deck's canvas size, theme,
table styles, media URL map and translator (`createTranslator()` from
`ooxml-ui/pptx/i18n`). The stage lays out at authored dimensions and applies
the requested scale; its host must reserve the scaled width and height.
Embedded hosts own navigation, media cleanup, asset lifetimes and presentation
playback. The renderer does not provide Office editing or collaboration on its own.

`loadPresentation()` resolves slide pictures, table fills and media using the
existing core handler and returns the archive handler, media URLs and deck
metadata. Dispose the handler and call `revokeBlobUrls()` on its returned URL
list when replacing or closing the document. Its options accept the core archive
expansion budget. Set `reading: true` on a slide stage for accessible reading
content and native media controls without editing overlays.

## Raw PowerPoint DOM lifecycle

Custom hosts using `ooxml-ui/pptx/dom` own the returned stage. Before replacing
or removing a stage (including thumbnails and offscreen export stages), call
`disposePptxRenderStage(stage)`, then remove its DOM. Disposal is idempotent and
releases that subtree's chart-sampler subscriptions immediately, even if no
later image-sample event occurs. It does not clear another stage's subscriptions,
remove nodes or revoke URLs owned by the host.

After closing all viewers/documents sharing the module instance, a host may call
`releasePptxRenderCaches()` to discard intrinsic-size, chart-picture-sample,
colour-change and duotone memoisation. This global operation invalidates pending
library-managed cache writes and chart notifications; pending decodes can still return results
to their original caller. Do not call it to close one viewer while another needs
pending samples. It cannot purge browser-internal decoded-image caches.

Intrinsic-size memoisation keeps at most 128 entries; colour-change and duotone
keep at most 64 each. These FIFO caches each have an 8 MiB conservative UTF-16
key/value budget. Oversized effect results still render without memoisation.

Bar-face picture sampling uses admission rather than eviction: completed samples
and pending requests together reserve at most 128 entries and 8 MiB (URL keys and
sample colours) for one cache epoch. Keeping admitted samples prevents a sample
notification/repaint from endlessly re-decoding a just-evicted image. If full or
a source key exceeds the budget, additional async sampling uses the existing
point/series-colour fallback until `releasePptxRenderCaches()` starts a new epoch.
Synchronously decoded colours still render even when they cannot be memoised.
