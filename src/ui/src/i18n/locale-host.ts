// Locale inheritance shared by the product elements. An app element (`<teams-app locale="de">`,
// `<mail-app locale="de">`) sets its own locale and hands it to every product element in its shadow
// tree: an element takes the nearest ancestor's locale when it connects, and a host pushes a change
// down to the elements it rendered. An element given its own locale keeps it. Extracted from
// `teams/i18n/runtime.ts`; the symbol keeps its original registry key so mixed builds still agree.
